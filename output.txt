Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Session starting soon
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Pinelandia present.
Gremlinxgrey: 
Australis is present .
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Maybe we should wait for some more delegates.
Session has begun
Well, this is a problem.
Due to the lack of people present, I am going to postpone this session until 7:30AM EDT 11:30AM GMT.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Noted.
j o s e p h: 
Sorry, for some reason relatives keep coming over to my place
do you want to start the session now, or begin at 7:30 EDT as you said?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe 7:30 would be a more ideal time as regardless of you being here virtually no delegates are here.
<div class="quote">Sorry, for some reason relatives keep coming over to my place
j o s e p h: 
I also want to apologise for failing to host yesterday, I'll try to be here on time from now on.
j o s e p h: 
Session starts in 5 minutes.
Addison Dillon - Neptunia: 
Florania is present.
j o s e p h: 
Orientia is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Australis is present.
Seems that waiting the hour and a half was a good idea.
j o s e p h: 
I concur.
Alright, is anyone else present?
Ok then, let’s start the session.
The first topic will be the future of the CA’s weather project. As you all know, it has fallen into inactivity for a while now.
Any thoughts?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'd like to ask how the program works, as I haven't been around since it started.
I think the problem with the program is that there's not a lot of documentation public on it.
j o s e p h: 
Basically it had a bunch of Discord bots created for different servers to announce weather forecasts, warn about impending dangers, etc.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I see.
The program has potential.
It just needs more attention.
j o s e p h: 
Here’s an example of one of the bots.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Haha! 26 degrees celsius and they're asking people to stay home.
j o s e p h: 
In my opinion it needs to be spread to more CA member servers.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We endure 45 degree summers in Australia.
j o s e p h: 
We have about 40 here in Thailand.
Is that it for the Weather Project?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Seems it.
j o s e p h: 
Ok, on to the next topic.
I assume you know what the CAGA is?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes, it's rather defined many sessions recently.
j o s e p h: 
There have been proposals to CAGA Act to be focused on only a few games.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Here's the link for the reading. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaGnCwl7gia6qx5y_R1g9xc9PUJ6ItC6u_lzChpL1Wo/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaGnCwl7gia6qx5y_R1g9xc9PUJ6ItC6u_lzChpL1Wo/edit</a>

j o s e p h: 
Yes, I’ve seen it.
Personally I’d want HOI4 on the list, as many micronationalists play it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
yes.
I also feel timeless games should be on it, with periodic trendy games.
j o s e p h: 
Hm
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Who's going to want to play scheduled Among Us tournaments in 2 months for example
j o s e p h: 
Such as what?
<div class="quote">Who's going to want to play scheduled Among Us tournaments in 2 months for example
What games would you call timeless though?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Minecraft, Tetris, traditioal games.
j o s e p h: 
I see
Next is the proposal to remove the CAGA ministry and to instead put it under the Ministry of Agreements and Development.
Personally I think it’s a great idea, adding a whole new ministry for a gaming association is unrealistic.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I dont think a gaming project is necessary or needed for Alliance at all.
j o s e p h: 
Is Pinelandia present?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have noted my presence prior.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think that if it were to be implemented, then it would have to be separate from the CA.
Like a different server
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
j o s e p h: 
I concur.
Alright, is that it for this topic?
Ok, next is the proposed renaming of divisions to ministries.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I really don't see why this should happen.
Ministries is quite an outdated sounding term to be honest. Divisions is a pretty good term.
j o s e p h: 
I concur.
Next is the promotion of William Efton to the Cupertino Service Ribbon.
I think he should definitely recieve it, he has contributed greatly to the alliance as well as being one of it’s founders.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
j o s e p h: 
There has also been a proposal to award Pun Watta the CA service ribbon.
Thoughts on both proposals?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes
I would support it.
j o s e p h: 
Same here, I have some bias with Pun’s promotion though as I’m his brother.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's fine, it'll go through three readings with various people, so it should be alright.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Humberlea is present
j o s e p h: 
The next topic is on the proposed Homeland Security Ministry.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
i apologize for how late i am
j o s e p h: 
It’s fine.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MOVhYz1vcBu5OuVJ1tFVBYNDeauN8M-V2LWDf5EAUSU/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MOVhYz1vcBu5OuVJ1tFVBYNDeauN8M-V2LWDf5EAUSU/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
All good.
j o s e p h: 
Thoughts?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I definitely think that the HSA should be passed.
j o s e p h: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's a vital piece of legislature
j o s e p h: 
Also, any thoughts on the creation of a Homeland Security Ministry?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I don't think an entire ministry/division is required.
j o s e p h: 
It could be helpful though, in some cases.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
i concur with the delegate from Australis.
j o s e p h: 
It is true, we’re kind of understaffed currently so I don’t think we could afford to create a another ministry/division.
Is that all?
Ok
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That is all comment I have on the bill.
j o s e p h: 
Next, what are your thoughts on the new regional sessions?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Very good in my opinion.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I think it would be benificial.
j o s e p h: 
This is the final topic before the membership readings.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
i also think it could help boost activity.
j o s e p h: 
It has worked so far, but not many members have been present in the Asian/Oceania ones.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Is this supposed to be a Asian/Oceania one?
j o s e p h: 
Yes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
All other delegates are welcome though.
j o s e p h: 
^
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I agree maybe they should be scheduled to start when more delegates are active.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Thats what time optimizations are for.
How many asian micronations are therE?
In the CA, that is.
j o s e p h: 
Not much, I believe
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Asian sessions should be merged with others where possible.
If this is an issue.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur
j o s e p h: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
For instance i am CST and was still able to attend this meeting.
j o s e p h: 
My timezone is 7 hours ahead of GMT and UTC
Next is the membership readings.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
ok
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Hm.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let me find them.
If Joseph is unable to or AFK

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
i've never heard of this nation before.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I've vaguely heard of it.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Tizian was involved in it.
That's a red flag.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Don't judge them by their history.
Acknowledge that they've moved on.
j o s e p h: 
Sorry, I was AFK
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Have they though?
j o s e p h: 
Aren’t they still part of Almendria?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
However, they have been rejected 3 times in the CA and banned from applying in GUM.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It would be foolish to not look at there history Tizian only temporarily stepped down.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed they are, I had it confirmed that it was an Almendrian Autonomous Republic.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I suggest we regect them and put a ban on them applying.
j o s e p h: 
Hm
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I think a ban is a bit extreme.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
A ban on the condition that it could be reconsidered should Tizian be no longer involved.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Would that link in to the HSA Bill?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Likely.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Very likely.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes!

Is that all for New Athens?

I'd support their entry.

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I approve
j o s e p h: 
We’ve had informal relations, they are quite ambitious diplomatically
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I've had very formal relations with them.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Would their delegates know English?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They seem very developed.

They’ve even proposed a cultural organization for Indochinese nations.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Strongly approve of Vishwamitra

Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Bojo May: 
Present
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I shall await a few more minutes till we start. This is an important session as its the final reading of 8 proposals.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Good morning
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Alas, let us begin without further ado.
Does anyone have any comments on the Cupertino Area of Natural Interest Proposal?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Nope, seems fine
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
May I clarify what this proposal is?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<div class="quote">It's fairly similar to a national park idea. I was thinking today about implementing an Cupertino Area of Natural Interest or something along those lines. Members would propose land/territories of Natural importance (history, beauty, formation, ect.) which would then be paired with other CAoNI'. These would be graded from Grade I to III (I bring average and OIL being top class) with members being entrusted to retain this status and improve the area (cleaning up litter, planting trees, encouraging wildlife, ect.)</div>
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Seems good
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to note that I shall be nipping to the shops. I shall. Read all comments upon my return.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Ok
Does anyone else have any comments on this item?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
None from me.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
In that case we will move on to the next topic on the agenda, the future of the Weather Project.
As you may know already, the weather project utilised webhooks and bots to deliver weather advisories to interested member's discord servers, customised to the weather profile of that particular nation.
It has recently, however, became inactive.
Does anyone have any opinions on what should happen to it?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Point of order
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to announce my return.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The issue is not regarding the activity of the program, instead of the new pricing system.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Oh
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Does Parliament find the usefulness of the weather program to justify the 3CAD a month charge?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
I was reading the same point from the Asian Aux session, apologies
LamentTwice: 
I am sorry for being late
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I personally cannot say I have used the system.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any further comments on the future of the weather project?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
None here
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
In that regard, let us proceed.
There has been talk of a couple amendments to the CAGA proposal.

Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Do we need a new Division?
And how much would this be used?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I oppose adding a new division
Would be better to add it under the Ministry of Agreements' mandate
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to note that the division debate is being discussed next.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Ok
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
My second question, then.
<div class="quote">And how much would this be used?</div>
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That is a very good question indeed.
I personally do not feel it would be used very much following the initial setup.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Please excuse my ignorance, what games are we talking about? Online? Shooters?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Rock paper scissors, discord games through bots, etc
Games that you have to buy would probably lead to low participation
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Thank you Sir
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Though none were mentioned within the proposal itself, session attendees have noted games such as 'Hearts of Iron IV' and 'Among Us'.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That is correct, outliners since a lot of micronationalists have those games, as well as Among Us being free on mobile

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any further comments on this particular notion?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
That sounds ideal
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I support any reduction of bureaucracy.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Noted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Nope
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Nothing  from my side
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Nothing
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Alas, let us proceed then.
There is a proposal to rename the Cupertino 'Divisions' to 'Ministries'. Do we have any comments, queries, or points?
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I don't see any additional benefits from a name change.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean we use Ministries so it would fit better
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
But I am not voting against if the majority supports this
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Any further comments?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
No
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Right.
It has been proposed that William Efton, and Pun Watta be awarded the Cupertino Service Ribbon. Do we have any discussion on this matter?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
I support both of these nominations
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I joined not too long ago so do not know any details about their history. I abstain.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
I am afraid due to family reasons I have to depart now.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Noted. Thanks for your attendance.
If we have nowt further, I'm happy to move to the next topic.
Let's discuss the national languages act.

R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Would this include all official languages of the member stares?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The languages are not strictly defined.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Though delegates will be able to contribute or correct language problems
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
To support and correct translations is a valuable benefit. I support this proposal.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Owt further on the matter?
If not, let us discuss the Homeland Security Amendment.

R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I support considering the number of authorities that have to agree
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
On this topic, there has been a proposal to establish a dedicated Homeland Security Ministry, who would also be required to sign a proscription.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Could an existing minister adopt this additional task?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There are already individuals required to sign as per the document.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
I am back
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Peto, do you have any comments on the discussions so far?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
None on either, they both seem fine as they are
I do not, however, think that there needs to be an additional Ministry for this sole task, however
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
That's my thought
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Now we got the policies out the way, let's have a discussion on the Regional Sessions?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
I think it works very well, and allows those who aren't normally able to attend the Main Sessions to still have a say in how the alliance is run.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
The have a reasonable time is most beneficial, as well as focusing on regional topics
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Very well noted.
Our next point of discussion is membership applications.

James B. - Desert District:

They seem like an interesting candidate.
Some other delegates have expressed doubts at the foundership claim of 1999 in earlier sessions.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I have questions about the foundation of the country.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Am I late?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Apologies
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It's okay
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Regelis was formerly a part of the Promatia Bloc, however we should look past that as it left said bloc due to the drama.
I believe their leader, Soaring, is highly capable and should be allowed to lead Regelis into the Alliance.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Soaring posted a very based article in r/micronations specifying numerous categories of micronations and finally providing a solid line between different types of simulationism and secessionism, for which I awarded a Gold Award via Reddit.
He is highly knowledgable as demonstrated by this and this is one of the reasons I believe that they should join. Not only this, but Promatia while they were still there had some really good concepts and plans. They may have been subject to controversy, but they were good at what their goal and intentions were.
My big supporting is now over.
HIghly based.

Alright then, it's 7:05 EDT, let's get started.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Very well then.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Thank you to all attending tonight, our first topic is the second reading of the Great Repeal Act, proposed by Mr. Valentinus.

I have a doubt. What is the Vai Lon Act?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Speaker, can you please brief on the Language Organization?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The Vai Lon act, originally proposed on the 21 March 2020 <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X8pdUZr8SZ079lypxnPatpR7jpERBbctXiKec4N__pw/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1X8pdUZr8SZ079lypxnPatpR7jpERBbctXiKec4N__pw/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
I agree with the act, and feel it is needed
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur. It is necessary to clear out unneeded and unused bills.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.

I concur. What about the Whistler Project?

I feel that Acts such as this should not be repealed, but rather revitalised
The Whistler Project has much potential still.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
With the dedication it would be a great addition to the workings of the Alliance.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Indeed.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Not that tourism is that big of a deal in micronationalism.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I propose that the Great Repeal act should be amended to ensure that some of the acts that would be repealed be instead revitalised by a committee.
Such as the Whistler Project.
Deleted User: 
I concur with the Speaker
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I agree to some extent.
Deleted User: 
But some have to be removed like Vai Lon Act
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">I agree to some extent.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I urge the Hon'ble Speaker to provide me with the documents. All terms are unfamiliar to me.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
After reading through these documents I believe the Great Repeal act should mostly be carried through.
However, I do not have much knowledge of the other documents in question.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">I urge the Hon'ble Speaker to provide me with the amendments. All terms are unfamiliar to me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, Mr. Speaker
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">However, I do not have much knowledge of the other documents in question.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes. That is the main problem.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Right. A link to said documents would be to much help.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
In the act.
Soaring - Regelis: 
Having looked at the Vai Lon Act, it shouldn't have been passed in the first place. It looks wholly unprofessional.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with the honourable delegate from Matachewan.

I concur with the delegate from Regelis.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I concur, as I have only seen the documents that have been linked.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
There's hardly a need for the Vai Lon Act.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
I concur
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
So I believe that the document should be amended to modify some to be revitalised, and for all of the mentioned acts to be linked before it can progress further.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Indeed.
Deleted User: 
Of course
Soaring - Regelis: 
I promote that more discussion take place as to what the document should include, going over the existing mentioned acts individually.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
On a side line, could anybody provide me with the bill format? That is, if there is any.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You're welcome.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I am going to bring up the Whistler Project, while I agree with its sentiment, it seems as though it would create a sizable overhead for CA if enforced. Discounting that most member states would have a constitution, as I wouldn't see why a nation new enough to not have a constitution would be permitted membership in the first place.
Deleted User: 
I agree
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Interesting to hear that point, I concur.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
That is true.
Soaring - Regelis: 
Though, CA exists to further micronational development. It should not exist as a micronational development service.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Very true.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
CA is one of the few highly professional organizations, but we also have to a bit specific during the acceptance of members.
It might seem that some nations join the organization in order to avail of the services offered.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Funny you would mention, this being my reason for requesting a bill format.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'll be back in a couple of minutes. Continue discussing as is.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Very well then.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We're a member of the Grand Unified Micronational, there's a bit of more selection as in comparison to the CA
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
This, and providing the organisation a proper definition to what is and is not an acceptable member.
I will be working on it this weekend and the coming week.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Alright.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Most nations here are new enough, but I won't say less professional.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Agreeable.
Deleted User: 
<div class="quote">Most nations here are new enough, but I won't say less professional.
Soaring - Regelis: 
CA needs to shift in a more professional direction. As someone who was introduced to the website while attempting to redesign it.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with my fellow delegate from Regelis.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I've returned.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Alright

Alright Mr. Speaker.

Is Regelis not a member of the League of Independent Nations?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Are we still on the original topic people?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
To be honest, I do support the idea that we should try to become more professional.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would urge my fellow Matachewanian delegate not to bring LIN into the talks.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe it is relevant to the topic.
Deleted User: 
<div class="quote">To be honest, I do support the idea that we should try to become more professional.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Of professionalism.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Right now we're viewed rather negatively in the eyes of the Old Guard, which I don't think we can do much about.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What is the old guard?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We can't change the views of the Old Guards, Mr. Ross.
Deleted User: 
But LIN is a different organization and CA is also a different organization
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I feel like it veered off after Soaring mentioned about furthering the alliance or whatever.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Are we not losing decorum?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
People, we will be maintaining session plan.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I apologize. Let us return to the session plan.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Please leave this discussion until after all bills have finished.
Is there any further discussion on the Great Repeal Act?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None.

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with Mr. Speaker.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Said act would lead to an election for the Minister for Asian and Oceanian affairs, which has not occured since the CA was founded.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And there was even a transition of power without an election
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The transition of the position alongside the delegate is frowned.
Tbh, it passed on like the Commonwealth Chair
Deleted User: 
<div class="quote">And there was even a transition of power without an election
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
More reason for an election to be hosted as soon as possible.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But we need an election, Mr. Watta is moreover a new face to the organization.
And has quite less roles in the nation.
He is no doubt a good administrator, but still, I would urge for an election.

I concur.

The progession of this act will likely be as normal, with three readings and a vote.

The bill says that after less than 2 weeks we can have an election.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
A reading is equal to a discussion/debate, or?
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Whether or not that occurs before Vishwamitra becomes a full member is unknown
<div class="quote">A reading is equal to a discussion/debate, or?

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'll try to be back as soon as possible.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I am able.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I can.
But I am an observer so, the rules might not permit me.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Great.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I inquire as to what has been covered so far?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
We have had the second reading for the Great Repeal act.
And we've discussed a proposal; the Asian and Oceanian Ministerial Elections act.
And the speaker went for dinner.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present.
I guess the Speaker's going for dinner is not a part of the business
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
As the session is not yet closed, I'll ask one final time if there is any more inquiries on any of the acts or on the proposal of a new one.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to inquire what amendments I shall make to the Great Repeal Bill, for the next session.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Off the top of my head I remember the Speaker leaning towards re-evaluating a couple of the acts listed.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Hausgurd is no longer present
Soaring - Regelis: 
I request a body of links to the referenced acts so that people can better review them.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I urge Mr. Protem Speaker to use bit of parliamentary language.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I'm sorry, was there anything wrong with my statement?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Off the top of my head could have been replaced by I forgot
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
No, it could not have.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But that's not a parliamentary language to be very specific.
You're on the speaker's chair, you must adhere to parliamentary terms.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
My acquaintance with the english vocabulary is none of your business, nor is it relevant to the program of the session.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Alas, we are getting off topic here gentlemen.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra:

I concur with Australis, that we should not be promoted to membership until we have met the specified requirements.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
As I said, my linguistic skills are none of your business.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I don't see anything wrong with his language. That's just the way he talks and it was still formal.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Can I ask his majesty the delegate from Vishwamitra to not make such a scene out of my english.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">I'm taking the matter with the Chair.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra:

Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
None from Ponderosa Hills.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
We should be allowed to see what the Great Repeal act entails in its entirety some time soon. Other than that, nothing more from me.
Soaring - Regelis: 
None from Regelis
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes, I too agree that the act should be further discussed in other channels outside of the session to develop it, and then to be presented again in the next session.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur with the honorable delegate from Matachewan.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
There is another reading of it, right?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Correct.
If no one has anything else to present or discuss for now, this session will be adjourned at 12:20PM GMT (8:20AM EDT).
Thank you to everyone who attended this successful 1hr 20 min long session, and may I just remind all delegates that formality and decorum must be maintained at all times.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's alright, just try to ensure you check when sessions are, at least a day before, and make plans to attend on time.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Will the transcripts be released?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm pretty sure those get released in gazettes, which haven't been released for a few months,
I'll make a document with just the transcripts, regardless.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Does the Matachewanian Foreign Department have the right to release it independently, shall the CA not be able to?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The gazettes are released very sparsely nowadays. The last two issues were made for slightly-more-recent sessions, excluding many previous.

I concur with the delgate from Desert District.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Speaker, may I have the floor to put my point?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia:

I would urge the Honourable Chair to look into appointing a new Dy. Minister and not switching it.
James B. - Desert District: 
Actually that is a fair point.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thank you for your comments, I do need to correct you but The Hon. Watta hosted the first Asian Aux. session which was successful. However, I'll be considering this change.
Deleted User: 
I agree with my fellow delegate.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Moreover, there's another point that I could raise.
I don't know how far it's gonna be true.
Deleted User: 
<div class="quote">Thank you for your comments, I do need to correct you but The Hon. Watta hosted the first Asian Aux. session which was successful. However, I'll be considering this change.
Which means?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The change from P. Watta to J. Watta was made in urgency and since both Wattas had connections with each other and the first Asian Auxiliary session was in a few days it was the only feasible option at that time.
Deleted User: 
Not much of a success
And Lowenia is absent
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
How can you believe that it's not a second account run by P. Watta with the name J. Watta?
But I guess, my points are wrong.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Tesforia is present
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The problem with the point given by the Hon. Basu is that the Auxiliary sessions are not meant to generate traffic, but to improve accessibility between each members. If we get 2 new members in a session, that is a success.
James B. - Desert District: 
To the honorable delegate from Aenderia I fully understand your decision but that doesn’t change the fact that now that we have the opportunity to appoint a worthy person the Deputy Minister we should do so.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
My office will be considering this change.
James B. - Desert District: 
Glad to hear.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would indeed say that Mr. Watta's first session went successful, but I urge the Chair to look into it.
Had he been more active, there was no need for an election or change
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Hon. Dhrubajyoti Roy, I am absolutely sure that Pun Watta and Joseph Watta are two separate persons.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I'll be also opening up an investigation regarding points made by Hon. Dhrubajyoti.
Deleted User: 
As to elaborate on what honorable delegate Jamez said, I do believe whoever is worthy and can do the job the best should be given the position.
James B. - Desert District: 
The honorable delegate from Australis without any notes ran an hour-long session that went well with few people, I think that shows he’s beyond earned the position.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Chair, I added the line that I wish the points I raise are false.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I'll still want to look into your points nevertheless.
Deleted User: 
I concur with the honorable delegate Jamez.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, but I wish I am not drawn into the investigation Mr. Chair.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright then.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I also concur with my fellow delegate from Desert District.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Does the parliament have further points of order regarding this bill?
James B. - Desert District: 
None from this Desert District delegate.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from our end.
I am no longer present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

May I have the floor, regarding this bill?
Please allow Mr Jamez to go first.

<div class="quote">Pls provide links to the said bills and acts
James B. - Desert District: 
And thank you Mr. Munroe.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I shall offer the floor to The Hon. Jamez first. Mr Munroe, you shall take it second.
Deleted User: 
Lowenia for the last time is absent.
James B. - Desert District: 
This bill in my opinion is very necessary to further the alliance.
The history of this alliance, while a large aspect of where it is today, is very different from today.
Deleted User: 
Bye everyone.
James B. - Desert District: 
Our evolution is without a doubt incredibly signifgant. To confirm with these changes, these repeals are needed.
Thank you. I hand it over to Mr. Munroe.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
May I have the floor proceeding Mr. Munroe?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Thank you, Mr Jamez.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think none of these bills should be repealed or reviewed except for the Vai Lon acts that seem to prove unnecessary within the alliance, however, some are entirely necessary for the well-being and future of the Alliance.
I yield my time and pass it onto Mr Xia.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Thank you, Mr. Munroe.
I'd also like the Cupertino Alliance Sister Cities Act to be repealed as well, as it is was written vaguely and headed by Ivan out of all people, who proposed the bill without even being within the Alliance.
James B. - Desert District: 
As Lowenia has one more minute of existence I’d like to offer them a final farewell from the alliance, from Desert District’s delegation team.
Deleted User: 
I can confirm this as the second honorable delegate representing Desert District. Farewell to Lowenia.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Also I would like to add the Sister Cities Act was never implemented nor used when the act was passed.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I can confirm this is the case.
Deleted User: 
Lowenia ceases to exist from now.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Should there be no objections, shall I add the Sister Cities act to the repeal docket?
James B. - Desert District: 
I do myself believe the Sister Cities Act is a valuable piece of legislation that should be enforced.
Rather than it be abolished it should be enforced.
It’s an effective method of uniting members.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I would say rewritten.
Deleted User: 
RIP Republic of Lowenia (2nd May-18th Oct)
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It should be rewritten at the very least, this act was written poorly

Deleted User: 
I concur with my fellow delegate the hon. Jamez. It is a valuable piece of legislation that should be enforced. By uniting members it benefits the people. 
James B. - Desert District: 
I absolutely believe a rewriting would be effective seeing the actual legislation.
The general content though is valuable in my opinion.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I don't really think we should enforce the program at its current state
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
The Sister Cities act is not great and i concur on it's removal.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
We should remove the current enforced act, and if someone is willing to rewrite it to a decent quality
Deleted User: 
But what about the possible opportunity of advancement of culture between the cities?
James B. - Desert District: 
Let’s repeal it but with an unofficial condition a similar act that meet our current standards shall be written.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I concur with Mr. Xia's opinion.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I do not think we should repeal the Vai Lon Act. Although it is immature, we should keep our history, and it is not even in force.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
<div class="quote">We should remove the current enforced act, and if someone is willing to rewrite it to a decent quality

I actually believe that Mr. Elder would be an appropriate writer of such an act though both of us are rather busy at the moment as school has recently gone back in person for the both of us.
I concur with the honorable delegate from Aenderia.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
<div class="quote">I do not think we should repeal the Vai Lon Act. Although it is immature, we should keep our history, and it is not even in force.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Why would the the Twin Cities Administration be under the Ministry of Culture?

Thank you hon. Jamez.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
James B. - Desert District: 
I additionally concur with the honorable delegate from Yu-Xia.
Deleted User: 
It would be because it is apart of culture of both cities. It should, shall I say, be apart of the Ministry of culture but not be the main focus. What are your thoughts?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
We have a Ministry of Agreements and Development if anything it should be under that.
James B. - Desert District: 
I actually totally agree with the idea of rather than creating a whole ministry keep it part of an already existing one.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with the honourable delegate from Humberlea
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur as well.
Deleted User: 
I concur
James B. - Desert District: 
I don’t know if Culture is the best pick, Development yes.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
<div class="quote">I actually totally agree with the idea of rather than creating a whole ministry keep it part of an already existing one.
Deleted User: 
There is no need to put more work into creating another Ministry in order for this act to go into affect. If it can be a branch of an already exisiting ministry it might make things go over more smoothly.
James B. - Desert District: 
Indeed.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I wholeheartly concur.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I fully agree
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Any further comments?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Not from me.
James B. - Desert District: 
Not from this DD delegate.
Can’t speak for Mr. Elder.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Nothing
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Shall the Sister Cities Act be placed in the repeal clause then, or is it being amended by future party?
James B. - Desert District: 
I suggest it be repealed and just rewrite rather than amend it.
Deleted User: 
I concur with Mr. Jamez.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It would be close to impossible to amend such a badly written bill.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
So I concur with the honorable delegate from Desert District.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Noted.
Let us proceed with the following bill.
James B. - Desert District: 
Very well.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Some delegates here believe a discussion regarding making the organisation further professional is warranted.
What are your thoughts?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
The organization is professional enough.
Deleted User: 
I believe that would be a great idea though I do not know how you would make it more professional. Of course we want to have a professional atmosphere and only have serious people in order to make this organization more efficent. 
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would be in support of stricter guideline although I do not think it is a top priority.
James B. - Desert District: 
I believe it’s warranted. I think archiving previous unprofessional events is necessary.
I do concur we have other priorities like furthering the alliance in general in the present, not just making alterations from events of the past.
Deleted User: 
To wrap it up I believe it depends on the situation of when we need to be professional and when we do not need to be professional, such as informal talk. Though I do believe their should be a base line or minimum respect of being professional(all aspects of the alliance.)
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Hon. Delegate for Regelis said last session:
James B. - Desert District: 
I fully concur with the honorable delegate from Regelis.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Deleted User: 
I concur as well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur but I think a way to achieve this is to make sure our members states are professional perhaps adding that as a requirement.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I concur with Mr. Burdette.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I concur with Mr. Buedette but the term 'professional' needs to be defined.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It is a very subjective term
James B. - Desert District: 
While I initially was skeptical of Regelis’s membership leading me to vote Abstain on their entrance into the alliance when I represented Ponderosa Hills, I think they have proven to be an extremely valuable asset of the alliance with some of the most potential of the whole alliance in just several days. They have rendered logos better, made prototypes of a future website, just as an observer and when that was not even close to expected by the members here. They have now given plans and tips as to how we can improve the professionalism of this alliance.
Deleted User: 
professional should be defined as taking something seriously and not moving away from the topic at hand.
James B. - Desert District: 
I do concur with the honorable delegate from Scoria, though.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
We have many member states that are unprofessional although I will not point fingers.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur with Mr Jamez.
James B. - Desert District: 
I do believe we could come to a consensus rather easily, though, regarding the definition of professionalism.
Deleted User: 
Hmm true, so are they serious members though?
James B. - Desert District: 
Who are you referring to Mr. Elder?
Regelis?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Burdette. I believe for the purposes of this debate, it would perhaps be beneficial to name said examples of unprofessionalism.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
No one will be offended, if they wish to explain why they disagree that’s fine.
I welcome your views.
Deleted User: 
In respect to being professional, would you say the nations you mentioned, Isaiah  Burdett, are being professional and serious during the sessions of the CA?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
No just the nation itself unprofessional.
Deleted User: 
As well as the overall aspect of the CA?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
<div class="quote">No just the nation itself unprofessional.
James B. - Desert District: 
What nation(s) are unprofessional?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Wendatia
James B. - Desert District: 
I actually must concur.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
They seem pretty professional to me.
Deleted User: 
I can not speak of the subject since I do not have enough information on Wendatia.
James B. - Desert District: 
The leader has completely unconstitutionally begun to not have elections for no reason beyond being lazy.
And just appointed them who he agrees with to his legislature.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur with Elder.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I ask what The Hon. Burdette himself deems unprofessional regarding Wendatia?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
There constitution is 2 paragraphs of bad writing.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
What would you define as unprofessional?
James B. - Desert District: 
Not following the Constitution knowingly because they don’t feel like putting in necessary effort is unprofessional in my opinion and I imagine others.
Deleted User: 
2 paragraphs of bad writing can be subjected to one's bias. When you say it is bad writing, do you mean in terms of it not being effective? Or in terms of it not following some of your particular inner beliefs?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Wendatia itself has no law format it ends up as a mess. Many one of their officials did not know they were officials.
Deleted User: 
If that statement is true. I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
I can confirm as a witness that is correct.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Would this affect the overall view of the alliance?
James B. - Desert District: 
I was just appointed to leading the Supreme Court and leader of the Legislature without my knowledge.
I left several days later do to this sort of thing.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
The same with me, but for Prime Minister.

I believe unprofessional nations taint the overall view of the alliance, and I do believe they have shown to be unprofessional.
Deleted User: 
Well that was only one nation mentioned, affirmative?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If our member are bad it could definitely effect the public opinion of the alliance.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The observership discussion for Wendatia proper is for another time.
Deleted User: 
May I ask is Wendatia considered a current observer or full member of the CA?
James B. - Desert District: 
Mr. Burdette, do any other nations come to mind if you’re comfortable answering?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Would a solution be to toughen membership requirements, or to enact an executive rejection protocol similar to the Grand Unified Micronational?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Their are other nations a personally dislike and consider slightly meme/ish but not enough to call them unprofessional.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">May I ask is Wendatia considered a current observer or full member of the CA?
James B. - Desert District: 
They appear to be full as the member cap and default observer alterations hadn’t been made. They haven’t actually attended a session though they’ve been here for only a week so I’d say it’s understandable.
Deleted User: 
I have an idea on this subject. If nations have a place for memes and are still professional in all other elements, then they can be considered professional. This would just mean that they work hard but also have fun as well. There would need to be a balance.
Is there anything more you can elaborate on Mr. Burdette?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
No that is all.

We’re a seperate alliance with different goals.
Deleted User: 
The goal is to be original and use effective methods. There is nothing wrong with taking elements from GUM as long as they work. We just can't become a carbon copy of them.
James B. - Desert District: 
It’s just possible inspiration for a system of rejection/acceptance.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We must also note that given our designation as a development organisation, is it not our role to help develop such nations?
James B. - Desert District: 
It is indeed our role.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Any further comments on the discussion of improving our professionality?
James B. - Desert District: 
I believe said discussion has wrapped up, let's move on.

James B. - Desert District: 
Thank you Mr. Elder.
On that note Mr. Speaker, may I have the floor?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed, the floor is yours.
James B. - Desert District: 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
As I have said prior, Regelis has shown to be  a very valuable member of the alliance, especially with their skills in graphic design and general digital things.
This website is flawlessly designed, is very bright, has only one small watermark, and is seamless.
It is fast, sleek, and would further the Alliance's web display.
I suggest the Chair take this site into consideration and possibly introduce some sort of digital ministry with Regelis's delegate in charge.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, back to you.

I will concur exactly with the delegate of Desert District with all these points, and advise the chair to adopt this new design.
James B. - Desert District: 
That is correct.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
And there is outdated info.
James B. - Desert District: 
It, with all due respect to whoever designed it, who may I say I am unaware who said person is, that the old website is beyond repair and must be restarted, whether based off the Regelis prototype or whatever you may call it, or not.
It is simply signifigantly outdated and no longer relevant.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Having an up to date designed web representance showing the correct infos is an element of being professional imo.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
Do we have any further points of order?
James B. - Desert District: 
Regarding the site, or the whole session?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The website.
We still have four discussions, and two membership readings.
James B. - Desert District: 
Then none from Desert District seeing Mr. Elder has departed the session.
And yes, I recalled which led to some confusion on my part.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Then I shall proceed to our next topic. The Alvin Matthews incident.
James B. - Desert District: 
I would like to say I have not actually seen any evidence of the incident. That is just a lack of research on my part, not a sliver of doubt, in fact the opposite seeing it spread so much across the community.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I was present during the Alvin Matthews incident.
James B. - Desert District: 
Could somebody familiar give a rundown briefly regarding it so all could contribute?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Can someone fill me in, I am not aware of such incident.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
A few news sites posted articles may i link them?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
What even is the incident about?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I've been in contact with various delegates about this incident but I still need more detailed information before taking action.

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
What would you like to see?
Be specific.
James B. - Desert District: 
This article, I believe written by you, is unreferenced.
I would like actual evidence.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Sure let me get some screen shots.
James B. - Desert District: 
That would be greatly appreciated.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Assuming such incident is well evidenced, what can the Alliance reasonably do?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
We could really only
James B. - Desert District: 
Ban any nations associated with him from being permitted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That too
James B. - Desert District: 
I am not suggesting this for the record, that is just a method of action.
I also concur with the honorable delegate from Aenderia's points.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Alvin Matthews was also blacklisted in Saspearian.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I'm still clueless, honestly.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Wouldn’t this be classified as raiding?
James B. - Desert District: 
I believe so.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I see.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I'll be continuing to discuss this matter with the Superior Judge
Related though should we create a Homeland Security Ministry for these purposes?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Was this not voted on?
Or discussed at the very least.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
As an opinion poll
James B. - Desert District: 
I think an opinion poll is a great idea for this.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think we should indeed create such ministry
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would prefer such powers be devolved to an existing ministry rather than opening a new office.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean the Superior Judge is basically that but I do want another opinion, as well as a Ministry with extended powers
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do the delegates present have further comment?

Nay.

I have made this document.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I'll pass it on to Superior Judge.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Lest there be no objections, let's have a brief chat about the Note Project hosted by The Hon. Jayden Lycon.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Vishwamitra is no longer present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Noted project is a project like Diplomabear but
I cede the floor.
James B. - Desert District: 
I wish I could participate.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Does USPS operate pick up at post office with government ID?
James B. - Desert District: 
I will contact my other delegate to see if he can do it and I sign it at school, though it is mostly likely impossible.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright.
Though the usage of the post office and the ability to write letters is a vital skill even for current times, however I can understand the views of your parents.
James B. - Desert District: 
I can't get my hands on a stamp.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Can you visit your post office though?
James B. - Desert District: 
No.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted.
James B. - Desert District: 
I can send a letter though.
Not receive.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do the delegates have any comments on this further?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I have no further comments
James B. - Desert District: 
If it would be asked for me to start a seperate one, I understand that is likely not convenient, I will.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Maybe next year.
James B. - Desert District: 
Sorry to go mildly off-topic, but if someone wants an unofficial thing where I start a chain but don't receive anything I would.
Just for the record.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to bring up our final topic: that of establishing a technology ministry.
James B. - Desert District: 
What about membership applications?
We have not yert reviewed them.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Applications go last
James B. - Desert District: 
I’m aware, he said our final topic.
Which if we intend to review them this is not.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It's generally its own section
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Aye, this would be the case.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Would the technology ministry absorb any other Ministries?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
To my knowledge, no.
James B. - Desert District: 
I think that wouldn’t be necessary.
&#92429;lͥunͣaͫ &amp; &#120284; &#119812;&#119834;&#119853; ᴛᴜɴᴀ ❦: 
New Eiffel is present
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
What would be the job of said technology Ministry?
James B. - Desert District: 
Pretty self explanatory.
Managing technology.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
technology as in the website?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes.
James B. - Desert District: 
That would be a notable aspect I imagine.
It could be server coordination perhaps.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Could we merge it with other ministries such as the Ministry of Microwiki affairs as that is technology?
James B. - Desert District: 
I again suggest Soaring of Regelis for the position assuming they become full members, and I would be shocked if they don’t.
No, MicroWiki is not from scratch like HTML websites.
I think they are too seperate.
Keep them that way.
The MW Affairs Ministry isn’t inactive and I doubt a technology ministry would be inactive.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
MicroWiki uses a markup language that turns into HTML i belive.
May be wrong on that one.
Anyway i would support such a Ministry.
James B. - Desert District: 
They’re quite different from making a website, Mr. Burdette.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Anything further before we move to applications
James B. - Desert District: 
Not from me.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
In that case, let us move to applications. I would like to apologise, but I do not have any remarks available at present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Minister was sick and was unable to finish them.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
First on the place, is Eiru.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I must abstain from comment on Eiru.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Aenderia will be departing.
James B. - Desert District: 
Very well.
Eiru doesn’t seem to be especially developed but I believe we are in a good position to do so.
I lean towards yes on observership though I’m not voting.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Observership is default for new applications from now on.
James B. - Desert District: 
I’m aware, just wanted to specify that is an especially good starting point for them.
Even if yes that’s the default.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is present, apologies for my absence.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I believe that Eiru is a fascist nation, but correct me if I am wrong.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I will be abstaining on Eiru.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What leads to such suspicions?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Noted.
Do we have anything further?
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">I believe that Eiru is a fascist nation, but correct me if I am wrong.
LamentTwice: 
I again apologise for being late
James B. - Desert District: 
They specified they agree with the ideology “not the atrocities committed by fascist governments”.
So I see no issue.
LamentTwice: 
It also seems that the session has been dragging out a bit
James B. - Desert District: 
It’s stayed active albeit long.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We have only 2 more applications and we are done.

James B. - Desert District: 
They seem very worthy.
I have no reason to doubt them, if someone does I’d appreciate if they made it clear.
Any comments from anyone?
.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have had no problems with this micronation, and would support their application.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with the honourable delegate from Pinelandia
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Now, our final topic. <a href="https://micronations.wikia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Duchy_of_Moletopia">https://micronations.wikia.org/wiki/The_Grand_Duchy_of_Moletopia</a>

Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
We don't have much to work with for Moletopia rather than their word
LamentTwice: 
I have never heard of Moletopia
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I can vouch for Moletopia
I have known the duke for pretty long and he is an excellent fellow.
James B. - Desert District: 
I have never heard of them but I am intrigued.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
As for Eiru, I will have to say no to them, their leader has said before that they wanted immigrants to be shot and also are a self-proclaimed fascist.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
And they do have a discord, if you would like me to send an invite.
James B. - Desert District: 
Oh my.
I’ve just realized.
I have the leader of Eiru blocked for a reason.
They randomly inquired in my DMs several weeks ago regarding if I was Irish.
I am going to be against them yeah, though I’m not voting I encourage others to.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I wasn't fully serious saying they should be killed but I don't mind if they are, Direct quote from the leader.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Christ..
James B. - Desert District: 
I can’t post images here.
I have an image of the DM.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
if you send it to me I can post it on behalf of you
James B. - Desert District: 
Sent.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Image on behalf of Jamez
James B. - Desert District: 
This was sent randomly.
I had never heard of the person prior, and I am Irish so somehow   they were informed.
I blocked them so I don’t have further messages with them.
Muchnieg I - Hausgurd: 
Hmmmm
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I support Pametchia for observership.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I will be voting no for Eiru.
Muchnieg I - Hausgurd: 
Weird question
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I do have a comment related to Eiru.
James B. - Desert District: 
Erm.
has just stated that he has received an ethnicity related message from Eiru’s leader.
I’ve requested a screenshot.
.
I’m very concerned he’s asking people if they’re Irish randomly.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Does he dislike the Irish or something?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
He lives in Ireland
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/554799257643647009/767483691806752798/image0.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/554799257643647009/767483691806752798/image0.png</a>
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
No, it is just if your a immigrant into Ireland he wishes to shoot you.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Oh.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Yes I'm 100% serious on that.
James B. - Desert District: 
Does the Chair have the ability to block applicants?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Concerning.
James B. - Desert District: 
Even temporarily for invetisgation prior to a vote?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I wonder why he is asking if people are Irish.
James B. - Desert District: 
This seems to warrant an investigation prior to a vote.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I will be voting no, he seems very suspicious.
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">No, it is just if your a immigrant into Ireland he wishes to shoot you.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
My friend has a screenshot, I might be able to get it from him.
James B. - Desert District: 
Does anyone know at the top of their head if the Chair or Minister of Membership Attainment or someone else can block someone from becoming a member?
Even temporarily?
I think if we don’t want a permanent block on it this needs an investigation.
However we have other priorities so we could just rather be safe than sorry and just permanently say no.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe this was the intention of the Homeland Security Bill.

James B. - Desert District: 
Maybe we should vote on the Homeland Security Bill before we vote on Eiru.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It has already passed
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
He is not a server raider.
James B. - Desert District: 
Oh.
Has a Minister been appointed?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't see need in blacklisting someone what's wrong with a vote?
James B. - Desert District: 
This dude supports killing immigrants.
Allegedly that is.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Just vote no.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Yes but he is not the nation.
James B. - Desert District: 
no matter your views on immigrants, no?
He is the planned delegate and leader.
He represents them in the alliance.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I can ask him right now if you still do not believe me.
Nevermind, he is offline.
But you can see the whole thing in the Matachewan server.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Unless the nation has said policies then it won't affect my vote.
James B. - Desert District: 
That’s a bit concerning to be perfectly honest Mr. Burdette.
He represents the nation.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
It is in the Eiru virtual consulate.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
If we admit this nation we're essentially allowing someone who supports killing immigrants to become apart of the alliance
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If we are rejecting people based on ideology of facism then Matachewan would have to be rejected.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Brandon doesn't want to kill immigrants
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="Brandon Mierzwa#3086">@Brandon Mierzwa</span>
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Also leaders basically are the embodiment of the nation
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
If Matachewan is fascist, why should they be in the alliance?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
For example Cycoldia was rejected from the GUM solely because of the distaste of the leader
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They are not fascist but Brandon is.
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">If Matachewan is fascist, why should they be in the alliance?
Brandon Mierzwa: 
I would like to make a statement that the nation has no ideology and does not follow my personal beliefs.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Brandon also doesn't force his ideology.
James B. - Desert District: 
If they’re communist why should they?
They’re general ideology doesn’t affect my vote.
Killing immigrants?
Yes.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I personally will be voting no
but i still think their should be a vote.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do the delegations have further comment?
James B. - Desert District: 
None from me, I just suggest a vote be at the least delayed.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If we have no further points of order by 45 minutes past, I shall adjourn the session.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I have another point.
Eiru counts felines as citizens.
Bojo May: 
Really?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Is the meeting still going on?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Aye
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
To be fair, Molossia does count their dogs as citizens
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Sorry for being late.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is no longer present.
James B. - Desert District: 
I like Molossia but they’re not very comparable to many other nations.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
And what are we discussing?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Eiru.
We were just about to adjourn before the citizen point was brought up.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe Eiru is serious in its intentions, but have troubles executing them.
James B. - Desert District: 
Erm
My message was just deleted.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Feline citizenry and everybody with citizenship being referred to by regnal numbers doesn't really make much sense.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<div class="quote">My message was just deleted.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe he can't show you, as it is deleted.
James B. - Desert District: 
It was a glitch.
It was nothing important, sorry for mentioning.
Just realized it was a glitch.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Noted.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
David from Eiru is a citizen of Scoria as well, we have created the Irish Micronational Council together.
I was not aware of his statemenf reg immigrants
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The Irish Micronational Council? Created and hosted by the Australian imperialist?
Along with the Global Micronational Council.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
He gave some support
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Confusing shall I say.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
You come to your own conclusions...
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Definitely
James B. - Desert District: 
They have no chance at this point, a consensus has been made in reality.
I say we move on.
Well just adjourn.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
<div class="quote">The Irish Micronational Council? Created and hosted by the Australian imperialist?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
My opinion isn't to be curbed by his presence, Mr. Lokin.
James B. - Desert District: 
We’re going in circles.
Let’s please adjourn.
7 minutes would be good, a 3 hour session.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="Indo-Malaysia#1882">@Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville</span>
Would be one of the longest ever, and certainly longest auxiliary.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I shall adjourn on the turn of the hour.
James B. - Desert District: 
Fantastic.
It’s been a very good session.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
We had great discussion and got to many points.
Thanks for attending and thanks for having me at my first full session (was only there for the end of yesterday).
And it’s time.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Thank you for some precious insights Gentlemen. Stay safe.
James B. - Desert District: 
Stay safe everyone,
and a final farewell to Lowenia.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Session Adjourned.
James B. - Desert District: 
You were a valuable contribution to our alliance.
Bye.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
 later.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Related to Eiru it turns out it was a false alarm.
They were also asking if people were Irish to see if they could join the Irish Micronational Council.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I must also concur
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I urge members not to commit in micro-war as it opposes our mission
Soaring - Regelis: 
I concur as well.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur
Woland - Desert District: 
I concur as well, and urge our members to condemn raiding as a practice
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I assume most members and observers alike  of the Cupertino Alliance are opposed to Micro-war
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
wendatia is very neutral and undecided on microwar.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian will not intervene in the Tungsten-MACP War.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Although I am opposed to server raiding, I do not think it should be taken this seriously. At the end of the day, it does not really matter.
LamentTwice: 
I have not heard of the Tungsten-MACP war
Soaring - Regelis: 
Regelis is very opposed to micronational war. We have vocalized it numerous times.
LamentTwice: 
can someone care to give a summary?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present, sorry for being late.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I advise members to talk about this war in other channels.

that is also a violation of the La Salle convention.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I must concur with Mr. Montan.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
<div class="quote">I have not heard of the Tungsten-MACP war
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It does not relate to the CA, nor are we interested in discussing further.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
anyways
James B. - Desert District: 
The pratice of both sides of participating is unacceptable, this war is unnecessary and brings back memories of the Almendria War, which nearly unaniously was a mistake on all parts including the former First Secretary of Desert District.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I also concur with Montan.
Soaring - Regelis: 
<div class="quote">I advise members to talk about this war in other channels.
James B. - Desert District: 
No.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
No... just don't discuss the war in Session Hall.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur with the Chairman.
James B. - Desert District: 
I think they mean because the war itself isn't relevant to the session.
Soaring - Regelis: 
Oh, I misunderstood.
James B. - Desert District: 
I also concur with the honorable delegate from Aenderia.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think we should move on, this isn't relevant to the Alliance.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Point of order
Soaring - Regelis:

Any discussion regarding this act?
James B. - Desert District: 
I believe it is necessary.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur with the Act.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I concur.

I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
Australian and Asian in particular micronations do not get the attention they desrve due to how sparse they are.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
It isn't my business as it doesn't affect me, in such case I will be abstaining from this motion.
James B. - Desert District: 
As a result, regional activity is vital.
This Act will increase said  regional activity, as such I am in favor.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I am in favor of it as well
Soaring - Regelis: 
I have a question related to the act. For what reason does the Junior Member role serve, and how is it functionally different from an observer state or a member state?

Any discussion regarding this?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
It is necessary for the current state of the discord micronational community.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I concur.
Woland - Desert District: 
How would the enforcement command function?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alliance server right now.
We do not have the powers to infringe on other member's Discord servers.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
how would a law enforcement service enforce the regulations?
LamentTwice: 
I do apologise for my absence
I propose we create a role made specifically for Aux. sessions
Soaring - Regelis: 
I second Scoria's question.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">how would a law enforcement service enforce the regulations?
LamentTwice: 
so that the delegates from the regions can only attend their continental aux. Sessions
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Please propose it after this topic
Woland - Desert District: 
So you’re proposing something to the effect of a moderation team?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes, but mainly an investigative bureau for complaints reached by the Superior Judge
Discord enforcement would be a secondary task
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
i concur with Jayden.
Woland - Desert District: 
I see no issue with this if that’s the case
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I agree with the gentlemen
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright then, I'll finish the bill later today.
Let's move on.
Some members have been petitioning for a Ministry of Technology for the management of the website and other technology areas.
Any discussion regarding this idea?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Isn't this already a duty by a certain existing position?
Soaring - Regelis: 
Which position?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Possibly by the Minister of Public Affairs, so I reckon it would be better to merge it and appoint a new Public Affairs Minister
James B. - Desert District: 
I believe that the positions in a Ministry of Tecnology are important enough it is worthy of a seperate ministry.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
It definitely is a very relevant task that should be officially assigned to a ministry, new or existing.
James B. - Desert District: 
Site management, social media management, server management and more deserve their own ministry.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I would be in favor of the existence a seperate Ministry of Technology position. I concur with Jamez.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Though the Public Affairs Ministry is already a more stressed Ministry, so I suppose a Tech Ministry is justified then
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
Indeed.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
nothing speaks against creating a new ministry, I concur.

I absolutely concur.

I concur as well.

Though I am not able to participate, it is possible one of Desert District's delegates could.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think things are fine the way it is now.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur with the bill.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I concur as I would like to participate.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I agree with the proposal
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean a majority of participants right now are concentrated in the East Coast, I'd prefer more geographical-diverse participants
Any further discussion regarding this topic?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
does michigan count in this plan?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Elaborate?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
does michigan count in the east coast or not?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Though if you're from the East Coast feel free to participate
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
alright.

I am sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Leon Montan informed me that he wished to amend the Charter Act by amending the Impeachment Chapter (which current affects Judicial personnel) to the motion of no confidence used by other positions. Any discussion regarding this idea?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
No.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
not from my side
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think it's a a great idea.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur, the impeachment process makes it complicated
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Having a simple confidence vote would simplify the removal of such position.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I concur, simplification of the process is favorable.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette:

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette:

If a delegate is available, they should be allowed to attend any session. Our mission is not to exclude, but to benefit.

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
None from I.
Wendatia is a observer.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Observer.
Woland - Desert District: 
I consider this law going against our principles. We allow member outside of a region to attend regional aux. sessions, and thus the reverse must be allowed, no?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Are they allowed to propose bills then?
Woland - Desert District: 
Therefore, I do not concur.

like laws and such
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have never heard of it.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
oh
basically it's the micronational community's freedom house
Woland - Desert District: 
I’ll need more information on the freedom project to make my judgement.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
alright.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">I’ll need more information on the freedom project to make my judgement.
Seems risky for data collecting if we don't do a background check.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Apart from the question of what the project actually is, what form of data do you expect to collect, and how?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
They don’t seem to have a microwiki page
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
It is a project me, Anna Telford, and Gaia Gr&#236;bhinneach are working on. It's goal is to document how the status of political freedoms and civil liberties are in micronations.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I think I heard of Anna doing some civil liberties thing this January, what data would you be collecting?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
like we would be looking at laws and de-facto levels of said freedoms in micronations.
so for example:
say Micronation 1 makes a new law promising freedom of speech, but does not uphold said law.
that is data we would be collecting for it.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
How would this serve to benefit the Alliance and its constituents?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
<div class="quote">I think I heard of Anna doing some civil liberties thing this January, what data would you be collecting?
Woland - Desert District: 
I feel measuring the “de-facto” levels would be hard as there’s a difference between legally outlawing something annoying and punishing them for being annoying on an online community.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
alright

I agree with Mr. Sertor Valentinus and do not see any benefit for the alliance.

Is there any other topics that the delegates present wish to discuss?
(before we move on to Memberships)
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If we have time to spare, I wish for a revisit of the urgent proposals outlined earlier.
Woland - Desert District: 
If I remember correctly the Pinelandian delegate wanted to return to discussion on the Homeland Security ministry.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright then.
<div class="quote">I propose the urgent creation of the Ministry of Homeland Security, with these following powers:

Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Atiera is no longer present, it's been a good session, I will put my remarks in an appropriate channel later

As mentioned prior, I oppose the creation of this ministry. We do not need a dedicated ministry for this, as the powers are vested already in existing positions.

Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea:

I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We have numerous delegates here who do not possess roles in the alliance besides national delegacy. It would be ridiculous to assume the honourable Supreme Judge carry this on his own two shoulders. These new delegates should be encouraged to take up such jobs to decrease workload and to encourage inter-alliance co-operation.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Though I suppose the replacement of the Public Affairs Minister first before a technology ministry is formed, the mandates between that and the Homeland Security are different
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Regarding these two proposals, I have nothing further to discuss.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Is there any final discussion regarding any other topic before membership?
Woland - Desert District: 
Nay
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
not from me
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would note that whilst I mostly agree with the proposal of regional autonomy proposed by Mr Roscoe (as it mostly aligns with the original intention of the Regional Sessions Act), the Junior Wing should be scrapped entirely from the text.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted.
Otherwise, let's move on.
The following nations can be upgraded to full membership:
Is there any discussion regarding observers above?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I am not sure about Vishwamitra but I do believe Wendatia and Desert District deserve the upgrades.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have no public items to discuss on said matter.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
All of them get my vote in favor.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
based on my interactions with Vishwamitra I vote for them to become full members.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I do believe there were some complaints on the October 18th session regarding Wendatia
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes.
I do wish to present this: <a href="https://micronations.wiki/index.php?title=Tungsten_Pact&diff=698423&oldid=698360">https://micronations.wiki/index.php?title=Tungsten_Pact&amp;diff=698423&amp;oldid=698360</a>

James B. - Desert District: 
I believe that Desert District has proven itself worthy of upgrade.
We have attended every available session, even at 5 AM local time.
We have had three active delegates.
We have jointly presented ideas for the alliance several times.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Personally I will be voting against Wendatia as their professionality has been questionable to say the least and also with what Jayden addressed earlier
I will be supporting all other nations pending for voting though
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I will abstain on Wendatia and Vishwamitra
James B. - Desert District: 
I believe that Wendatia should be retained obsership.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I implore the members to look at the profile picture of the Wendatia representative.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
We shouldn't judge on things as trivial as that though
James B. - Desert District: 
I believe Vishwamitra is a highly professional nation and an Indian nation is of great value in the micronational community.
Though I am not voting, I support their full membership.
Woland - Desert District: 
I feel their profile picture has no bearing on our judgement.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Due to several matters, I shall vote against membership of Wendatia and Vishwamitra. I will however support full membership for Desert District.
James B. - Desert District: 
I say give Wendatia another chance, therefore retaining observership as opposed to an upgrade or expulsion.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Profile pictures, unless they show any NSFW photos, should not be judged upon.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur. I'm sure we have all made questionable choices on social media...
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Woland - Desert District: 
Exactly. If the Wendietan wants to make his profile picture “Shitass”, who are we judge?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I feel like Wendatia was admitted as an observer before they were ready to become apart of the alliance
James B. - Desert District: 
Also, there are uh.... certainly other things to criticize Wendatia for.
So using their profile picture is a bit excessive.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
And they do not seem to have elements of a micronation six months or older
James B. - Desert District: 
That is actually correct.
Yes, honestly looking deeper they need problems fixed that are important enough that our help won’t be of any value to them.
I support expulsion.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Their initial support of a server raiding faction is concerning, alongside many other factors regarding the delegates professional behaviour. I would note that their observership had only passed by an incredibly slim majority.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Wait isn’t Wendatia an observer?
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes.
James B. - Desert District: 
To be fair our observership passed by a slim majority and I (being admittedly biased) think we are worthy of an upgrade.
That being said, they still have not shown themselves worthy of observership, let  alone full membership.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have concerns regarding one of the applicants, but given its very sensitive nature at present, I have opted to send it to the chair only.
James B. - Desert District: 
I assume it is with Vishwamitra?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I said one of the applicants. It could be you in fact.
James B. - Desert District: 
My assumption stands but noted.

I am going to check to see more information about them before coming up with a decision.

It has been proven it he was being sarcastic, but it is still a bit unsettling.

Regarding this, of course.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You have the floor.
James B. - Desert District: 
Millania and Lytera have shown that they have no interest in contributing to the alliance.
Both have shown a pattern of stating their nation is present at a session and not saying but a word for the rest.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
That is true.
James B. - Desert District: 
Lytera has not been active in a session since June.
Millania even longer.
To retain their membership,
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I do note that Lytera has ignored session optimization forms and a message if they wish to join the Noted project
James B. - Desert District: 
we are setting a precedent that inactivity is fine for some but not for others.
Therefore, both should attend a session within the next two weeks, or they should be expelled.

Alright, this is a question.
Were you planning on the expulsion of wendatia or not? I am still confused on what you were talking about above.

Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
i see.
For the record, when i first supported the Tugnsten Pact, i had 0 clue it was a raiding group.
Once sertor told me it was, i withdrew diplomatic support.
James B. - Desert District: 
Joining a pact without knowing their intent is just poor judgment.
Even if you didn’t know.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted, is there any discussion regarding Lytera, Millania, or Wendatia?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
i did not join the pact.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Elaborate the word join
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I have to concur with Mr. Jamez, no matter if joining or supporting
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to clarify that Wendatia provided diplomatic support, rather than joining the pact.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Said support was then withdrawn when i found out it was a raiding group.\
James B. - Desert District: 
For what reason did you provide diplomatic support?
What was the diplomatic support exactly?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
There was not much, and it was a de facto expression.
James B. - Desert District: 
And what did you know about them when you provided said support, and what caused you to miss that their was raiding going on?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
all i knew is that they were at war with the MACP.
James B. - Desert District: 
So you’re admitting you are participating in the war?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
no.
i did not praticipate in any raids
James B. - Desert District: 
I didn’t ask if you participated in any raids.
I asked if you are participating  in the war.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
no.
James B. - Desert District: 
Noted.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
i did not praticipate in the war.
James B. - Desert District: 
Okay all questions I’ve had are answered.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">You have the floor <span class="mention" title="Indo-Malaysia#1882">@Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville</span>
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
my bad.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Prior to the opening of session viewing to the general public, and the reformation of membership via observer period, this was not as big of an issue.
James B. - Desert District: 
I don’t think observers should be barred from discussion of a vote.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I think these are mostly good ideas. Should a membership session be held, what should be the frequency of these sessions and whom should be sessions? I also do think observers should be able to attend these sessions.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
i concur with Jamez
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What if we are discussing said observers? Perhaps we have discovered something rather sensitive regarding such, but a member feels uncomfortable sharing it with the session because of the obvious.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You have a good point there
But, should the observer affected be able to rebut, object, or explain these claims?
James B. - Desert District: 
Exactly. They can’t defend themselves.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Except now in that situation, the theoretical person who originally made the complaint is now being potentially harassed in private.
I appreciate the points, but there are some matters that for a time are not appropriate to publicise in an open forum.
James B. - Desert District: 
Some
You’re proposing a full move.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I concur.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I abstain
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Yes, I am proposing a full move.
James B. - Desert District: 
Because of some information.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Correct.
James B. - Desert District: 
That is like cutting a piece of paper with a saw instead of scissors.
Way too big of a change for a small thing.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is it small?
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I see valid point in both arguments.  Creating another session hall for members only?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Along the lines, yes.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I would then disagree with this proposal by sertor.
James B. - Desert District: 
Make a channel just for sensitive info but don’t censor non-sensitive info from observers.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I concur with jamez.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is potential debate worth the risk of members being harassed?
James B. - Desert District: 
Erm...
Is there anything else we need to get to?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
When it comes to matters such as discussing the merits or sins of a nation, these matters are notorious for kicking off vendetta and grievances.
Case in point, the discord server hosted by the MicroWiki website.
Just had to get that matter out there.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
no further questions from me.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
No further questions
Otherwise, is the any further discussion or any topic submissions before we adjourn the session?

We addressed it and you’re an observer.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia:

Written by yours truly.
I'm going to expand on my act
Bojo May: 
I will read
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
So the point of the act is in the name, to increase regional self-governance, in order to promote activity on a regional level.
This would be done by implementing the Junior Member system.
Junior members may apply to become members of the Cupertino Alliance in their respective regions.
Deleted User: 
Vishwamitra would like to support this act.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Said Jr. Members can only attend sessions corresponding to their region, i.e. an Asian Jr.Member can only attend an Asian session.
LamentTwice: 
Sounds like what I tried to propose yesterday
that was shot down by everyone however
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I see that as a good idea, given it doesn't require unnecessary work; which I don't expect of it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This was proposed as the second item of yesterday's session.
So it's the second reading tonight.
Deleted User: 
I want to make a point.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
please wait until I've explained the act.
So Jr members, after a set period of time, may apply to become full members similar to how an observer may apply to upgrade their membership.
<div class="quote">I want to make a point.
Deleted User: 
The disadvantage of this act would be that the Asia Jr. Member cannot attend another session other than Asia Auxillaries
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's the point of the act. Having junior members would greatly increase <strong>regional</strong> activity.
Deleted User: 
Suppose if a Europe session is favorable for an Asian member, then he/she cannot attend as the member cannot attend it
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The point of a regional session currently is only for time optimization. An Asian session is made to be favourable for an Asian member.
This is also a part of the act; to broaden the purposes of Auxiliary sessions.
Deleted User: 
I cede.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Is there any more discussion on this topic?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Would this affect the frequency and/or focus on the central parliament sessions?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The whole timetable would be unaffected.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
But the aux. sessions would only be given a greater purpose... right?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Correct. Said topics in these sessions would be driven to a more regional topic. For example, one of these sessions might hold an act only applicable to respective region.
Deleted User: 
Example Mr.Speaker
Bojo May: 
So what are we talking about
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
In that case, this act has got my support.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
A European member may propose an act only applicable to Europe, for example titled the 'European Collaboration Act' or something. That's only going to be useful for Europe, so Europeans would vote as opposed to an Alliance wide vote.
Deleted User: 
I concur
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">So what are we talking about
Patrick Kenny: 
Would the junior members need to apply or would it be automatic? in relation to full membership
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe, if I understand correctly, that it would work the same was as observership. And in what way an observer can do anything.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Jr Members would apply using a similar/same application as a member.
Bojo May: 
Please scroll up to see.
You*
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Perhaps it could be a successor to Observership.
Admittedly, this is a major act that would shape the Alliance in major ways.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Is it any meaning to tampering with the membership process in order to enact this, shall it be passed?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Could you please elaborate on that?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra, for example. Has a say through its delegacy to the Alliance, although not being an official member.
Would a change to the independence of regional sessions need to change any of that?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I don't think it would change that.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Right.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Is that all on this topic?
Deleted User: 
None from Vishwamitra
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Likewise.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright.
Moving on
Creation of a Homeland Security Ministry
There's not much available on this act
I propose the urgent creation of the Ministry of Homeland Security, with these following powers:
By Jayden Lycon earlier today.
I believe the homeland security act was passed earlier. I don't think it needs a dedicated ministry.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I'm sure it doesn't have any disadvantages.
Patrick Kenny: 
Would this Ministry have the powers to intervene in member states domestic security policies?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I would assume.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Unsure, you'd have to contact Mr. Lycon.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
May I advise that I believe my fellow representative from Matachewan, King Brandon would be perfect for that position.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Patrick Kenny: 
Sorry for my ignorance but would this act, in theory, centralises the members domestic security into one alliance department, or am i looking into it too much?

<div class="quote">Sorry for my ignorance but would this act, in theory, centralises the members domestic security into one alliance department, or am i looking into it too much?
I'm already doubtful of this ministry.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I would expect that the department has at least something to say in regards to the members domestic security, which I would support.
But that it can forcefully intervene, is where I draw the line.

Patrick Kenny: 
Intervening in another country's internal workings, even an alliance member, sounds to me to be a very slippery slope
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I don't see how a central advisory department on security and/or response to hostilities can be anything but benefitial.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Provided it's only advisory.

Ties into the ministry proposal just discussed.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Would you post the link to it?
Patrick Kenny: 
yes please
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Furthermore, I also propose the urgent creation of the Investigative and Domestic Enforcement Command, a law enforcement service geared to  -Discord enforcement within this server - Investigative services for raiding violations, other violations related to the Alliance, etc

Is that all in the proposal?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
There's no link.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
When did we stop utilising the formats?
Deleted User: 
I concur with this due to the recent raids that have happened in other micronations.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We still use them, this is an urgent act recently made.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I say, if a server is raided. That is up to the individual people in charge of it who mingles with the wrong people.
If that's understandable.
Patrick Kenny: 
It is and i do concur
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The only nations that I see have problems with this are those who consciously involve themselves in mindless simulationism.
And community drama on that godforsaken subreddit.
Deleted User: 
<div class="quote">The only nations that I see have problems with this are those who consciously involve themselves in mindless simulationism.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
And?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I see nothing wrong with simulationism, so long as it doesn't threaten other serious nations.
Deleted User: 
I concur
Vishwamitra is now absent
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
That is exactly what it does, Mr. Speaker. And that's why there is something wrong with it, while not in theory, in practice, and it shows.
I learned very recently that Brienia is no more than a political experiment, for example.
Pavlov, and the people involved with it, are sadly influential in the general community, yet is no more than a political experiment.
Patrick Kenny: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">I agree with <span class="mention" title="Chris.#0427">@Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra</span>, server raids are a product of mindless simulations, or in other words a byproduct of it, if your whole nation is just on a discord server with no physical power and authority and not sure the alliance can help you. On the other hand, by having a central authority it may help root out these Simulations and make memebrs aware of them.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
This circles around to the point of the topic, as these people, influential or not, should not be a matter of the Alliance.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><div class="quote">I agree with <span class="mention" title="Chris.#0427">@Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra</span>, server raids are a product of mindless simulations, or in other words a byproduct of it, if your whole nation is just on a discord server with no physical power and authority and not sure the alliance can help you.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Glad that we're on the same page.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
So basically to summarize it, this act would act as a micronational Interpol, in a sense.
Patrick Kenny: 
The problem i can see is salami tactics on the members autonomy, if more bills like these are made and enacted
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If i interpreted it correctly.
Patrick Kenny: 
Thats the problem
its so broad and bland, i would move to put this one on hold chaps till its been flushed out more
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I can see that it can function as prescribed, given it swerves away from even acknowledging the byproducts of simulationism, as Patrick called it.
Patrick Kenny: 
as long as we see more information on the proposal, I will not give a vote to the agreement till that time
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It needs a document.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The proposal needs to be properly formalised.
It conveys stupid little information.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I will too be abstaining  until this and previous act have been formalised.
Patrick Kenny: 
then i believe we are agreed
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Yes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any further comment on this matter?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
None.
Patrick Kenny: 
None from Australis
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Understood
Moving on
Creation of a Technology Ministry
There's literally no info on this
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Wow.
No info?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm going to infer based on context it'll manage technology
Website, etc
Patrick Kenny: 
It sounds like a central Tec Ministry, i would vote no and comment that it would be up to the individual nations to have Technology agreements not the alliance as a whole
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If this is the case, I see that it could be merged with Ministry for MicroWiki Affairs.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe it's only a matter of renaming the MW Ministry.
Which I would support.
Patrick Kenny: 
so no functional change?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Does the Alliance have a website?
Patrick Kenny: 
?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
If the answer is no, I am going to have to support the implication of dedicating the creation of one to a department.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
is developing a new one.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Alright then.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think Microwiki Affairs should just be renamed and have this incorporated
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Yes.
Patrick Kenny: 
Agree
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any further discussion?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
None.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Understood, moving on
A urgent bill consisting of repealing Observership project restriction just for the Noted project as
Patrick Kenny: 
I abstain as i have little knowledge about the project
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe the project should be a matter of its members as much as I believe that propositions should be conveyed through their determined format.
Are we still here?
Patrick Kenny: 
We are
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes.
Patrick Kenny: 
like before, i know little about the knowledge and dont want to give a opinion
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted project is a project intended to send a letter across the world to full members
And gaining signatures, before it arrives back in Canada.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Matachewan is for the upcoming couple of minutes no longer present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Understood.
if there is no further discussion, lets move on
Patrick Kenny: 
Alright
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Charter amending on judicial impeachment
No info on this
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Matachewan is present and I wish to see something on that.
Is there a document or a statement or anything?
Mr. Speaker?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Sadly  no info.
I think move on.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Agreed.
Patrick Kenny: 
I agree

Click here and read the earlier discussion for info on it
Freedom Project
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Is there any point in doing so?
How would it be done?
There is so much I would like to know but so little information on it.
<div class="quote">I feel measuring the “de-facto” levels would be hard as there’s a difference between legally outlawing something annoying and punishing them for being annoying on an online community.</div>
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm not sure on it.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
In that case, I would support moving on from that as well.
Patrick Kenny: 
Sounds like too much world for little gain and little information
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I agree with what Patrick said as well.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Okay.
Moving on?
Membership s
Upgrading Vishwamitra to a full member is in this proposal first.
I would personally endorse this, they have shown to be a professional nation.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I agree.
Patrick Kenny: 
I agree
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Okay.
Wendatia's full member upgrade.
Opinions?
Sorry if I'm going fast.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I agree. Though I do not know much about Wendatia, they did attend the oblate convention therein they showed to be professional at their intentions.
Patrick Kenny: 
i have had the pleasure to meet them so i abstain
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I have to go and do some things now, so I may not be here for the rest of the session. As such, I'd be making Mr.Miller Speaker Pro Tempore, and Mr.Kenny to represent Australis mainly now.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Alright.
Patrick Kenny: 
Alright
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Given nobody has anything to add on upgrading Wendatia, we will move on to Deser District.
Personally, I do not like their definition of an official portrait which I feel might impact their professionalism. But take that with a grain of salt as that is only my view based on the little I know.
Patrick Kenny: 
Official Portrait?
whats there definition?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I will not speak on their behalf. But I feel as the abundance of Snapchat avatars to represent their politicians officially is a bit odd.
But as it may not be relevant to their political professionality I am going to vote abstain.
to add his opinions.
And unless anybody has more to say, I urge we move on to the Imperial Republic of Eiru.
Patrick Kenny: 
I have nothing to add
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Eiru is complicated to me.
Patrick Kenny: 
Why is that?
Bojo May: 
I am busy I haven’t read it
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
They give citizenship to felines, encourage the use of regnal numerals for every citizen. Yet they show their dedication and professionalism towards their ambitions to such an extent that I might vote yes.
Patrick Kenny: 
Let me see
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
We have 4 more nations to go through.
<div class="quote">Let me see
Patrick Kenny: 
From my limited knowledge, i would vote no
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra:

Patrick Kenny: 
For me they are too new
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Is there any further discussion on this?
Patrick Kenny: 
None from Australis
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Then I suggest we move on.
Patrick Kenny:

I would like to say that Monmark has a purposefully weak foreign policy and consciously engages with simulationists though not identifying as a simulation.
For this, I will vote no.
Patrick Kenny: 
I would vote to abstain, as although they do meet all the requirements, im worried about there Simulationist foreign policies
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Does anybody have anything to add?
No?
Then we shall move on.
Patrick Kenny: 
wonderful
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra:

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
How old is it?
Oh Feb 2020
I'll be off again, sorry for continually dropping in and out
Patrick Kenny: 
I would vote yes
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Then we agree.
Would anyone like to add anything?
Patrick Kenny: 
None from Australis
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
None from me either.
Then we move on once again.

Bojo May: 
How long have they been around for

Okay then.
Any further remarks?

No more discussion from my side.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Understood.
Would anybody like to present any acts or topics?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
No.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If not, session will be adjourned at 1:25PM UTC (9:20AM EDT)
Thank you all for attending this successful session despite its small size.
Further evidence why we need greater regional development haha
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Pinelandia present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
But this session will have been 2 hours and 25 minutes long.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Oh.... gosh darn it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Don't worry... Technically you're present. Haha
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Session starting soon.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Atiera is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Australis is present.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Aenderia will be present but will not be active as much during the session
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Noted.
For todays session, we will be performing the final readings for several pieces of legislation and membership votes, alongside a few new discussions.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.

Do we have any comment on this piece of legislature?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Speaker, may I?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm biased because I wrote it, but I think it's necessary.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Dhrubajyoti shall take the floor.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you Mr. Speaker.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I concur with the honourable delegate.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Mr. Dhrubajyoti, that is the point of this act - to boost the amount of activity and nations in a region. And there will not be an Aux and regional aux, Jr Members will be able to attend Standard Aux sessions for their region.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Please pardon me, can I be addressed by my surname and not by my name?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm sorry for the error in my decorum, it was not listed, Mr. Roy.
LamentTwice: 
Nova Troms&#248; is present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
However, my point that I have stated is logical.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd suggest that the act, be re-introduced once we at least have 7-8 members from Asia &amp; Oceania.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Basically, currently we hardly have 5 members from the region
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I concur with the honourable delegate. At this time, the act is unsustainable.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
How are we supposed to recruit members in these regions without an active program to do so?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
May I ask a question?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Peto, you have the floor.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Thank you Mr. Speaker,
LamentTwice: 
I apologise.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
please maintain decorum within the session hall.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Speaker, I'd like to answer to Mr. Roscoe's statement made just before Mr. Peto's seeking permission
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I will answer.
I am the author of the act.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Proceed Roscoe.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
So, Mr. Roscoe would ask himself a question and then answer to himself?
I was supposed to speak to this:
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Oh sorry, my bad, I thought it was in regard to Mr Peto's statement.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
No issues.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Continue.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thanks.
I don't think that would make any difference
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Matachewan is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
And why do we need, junior members?
We already have full members, observers
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We should introduce autonomy for active regions until malnourished regions grow larger in my opinion.
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">Basically, currently we hardly have 5 members from the region
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Junior members would be necessary for regional development.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
May I have answers to my questions?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We can have regional developments, without having junior members
LamentTwice: 
I believe that Junior Members are for restricted members who the delegates believe aren’t fully ready for the alliance.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
These Jr members could eventually become full members, solving the 5 member issue.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
I believe Mr. Roscoe would be best placed to answer them, as the author of the act.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I don't think we should get in any nation which is not ready for the organization
We have to be professional
and not trainers
LamentTwice: 
<div class="quote">I don't think we should get in any nation which is not ready for the organization
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What is the subject?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Can I also focus on another ignored point of the act?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Pardon me, I removed that because the Speaker was typing
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This act would allow for acts specific to regions to only have to go through the respective region (Example: European Example Act, would only be voted on in an European session by European delegates, because it is only regarding them.)
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Instead of implementing that, I'd suggest for larger autonomy for the regional sessions
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As opposed to a minor regional act going through multiple sessions and much bureaucracy.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But still, there would be a loophole
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Roscoe, do you have an answer for Mr Peto's earlier query?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Sure.
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">and not trainers
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
To be very honest, I'd suggest that the bill be considered later and not this moment
James B. - Desert District: 
Growing and furthering nations is what we do. I just disagree with this method.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<div class="quote">Thank you Mr. Speaker,
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I won't say that the bill is bad, but it can be implemented when we have good number of nations
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm sorry I brought this act up. It's obvious that it's highly underdeveloped and not needed in this way. I rest the proposal, and I don't have the answers to all these questions.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Instead, we can look to invite more Asian members
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm not feeling 100% tonight, so I'll only be occasionally popping in.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I know a lot, that might help
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Noted.
<div class="quote">I'm sorry I brought this act up. It's obvious that it's highly underdeveloped and not needed in this way. I rest the proposal, and I don't have the answers to all these questions.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah... Sorry for the waste of time. I'm really not feeling great.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Its no issue, it was a rather interesting point of discussion.
LamentTwice: 
May I ask an off-topic question to do with today’s session?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Instead, we can look to invite more Asian members
LamentTwice: 
Will we be discussing any membership applications today?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed, it is on the agenda.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes, in due time.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Alas, let us proceed with our next point of discussion, the proposed Technology Ministry.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any comment on the proposition?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from our end
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aren't there any other asian organisations we can work with?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What would it entail?
LamentTwice: 
<div class="quote">Aren't there any other asian organisations we can work with?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
<div class="quote">Aren't there any other asian organisations we can work with?
Yes, there is one. and I lead it.
LamentTwice: 
I’m thinking of a different one.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe we could instead partner with some organizations such as the Australian Micronational Council, or at least some of their members.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It's on the building steps, but we are trying to strengthen it
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to point out that we have moved on from this point of discussion, and we are discussing the technology ministry.
LamentTwice: 
I cannot recall the name.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
<div class="quote">I’m thinking of a different one.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'll also reach out to Sonderan and see if I can get them interested.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Try with Matthewopia also
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Either move this point of discussion to the member halls, or await till the end of the session.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Apology, Mr. Speaker
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any further comment on the third reading of the 
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
None from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, I do have something to speak.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Proceed Mr Roy.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The Ministry is needed for the organization, and also would suggest that the MW Aff. Ministry is merged with it, because it's mostly falls under tech subject
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
<div class="quote">I believe we could instead partner with some organizations such as the Australian Micronational Council, or at least some of their members.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
It is.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Just because a nation people have negative relations with doesn't mean the whole org is bad.
Anyway move to another channel.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I would rather say that it has negative relations with people.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any final comment on the ministry, or shall we proceed?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Nay
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from my end, but I would request that my comment above is looked into
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
No comment.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Let us have a final reading into the proposed removal of the observership restriction from the Noted Project.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I'm against it.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do any delegates have any points of order regarding this proposition?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Yes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Miller, you have the floor.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Hausgurd is no longer present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd like to speak after Mr. Miller, Mr. Speaker.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have noted duly this statement from the honourable delegate.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The Noted Project is a project of the Cupertino Alliance, and not of anyone or anywhere else. Matters of the alliance are matters of its members and the point of observership is to observe. As they are not accepted into the alliance, matters of it do not necessarily regard them. Why should there be an exception with the Noted Project?
The project should be a matter of the alliance and its incorporated members only.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Mr. Miller.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
May I speak now, Mr. Speaker?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Proceed Mr Roy.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I would also concur with Mr Miller.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I completely disagree with Mr. Miller and Mr. Xia, the observers are not here solely to observe, they are a part of the alliance and are incorporated in to see how things work and learn things that'd benefit them to be a full member.
Thank you Mr. Speaker, for giving me the opportunity to speak.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any more comment on this proposal?
LamentTwice: 
I concur with Mr. Roy, I believe that observers are also a part of the CA, not some backwater candidates for membership
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur with Mr. Roy
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with the second part statement of Mr. Konstantinos, pardon me, I'm not aware of your surname.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Be it noted that I will be away from the session for about 10 minutes.
LamentTwice: 
It is Hockenheim.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thanks, Mr. Hockenheim.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Shall we proceed to the next reading?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, I think Mr. Speaker, I've nothing more to speak on the last reading
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I have nothing more to say either.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Let us begin the third reading of the Micronational Freedom Project proposition.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I did not attend the last two sessions, can I get a brief on the project, Mr. Speaker?
LamentTwice: 
^
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Rhymer of Wendatia proposed a project collecting data from Cupertino Alliance nations, such as laws.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
What does the said delegate mean by data?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<div class="quote">It is a project me, Anna Telford, and Gaia Gr&#236;bhinneach are working on. It's goal is to document how the status of political freedoms and civil liberties are in micronations.</div>
LamentTwice: 
I am slightly skeptical towards that project.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It has a lot of meaning, so I wish to know what specifically he meant
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">such as laws.</div>
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd like to speak on the project in details
LamentTwice: 
Some nations believe that they need to protect some laws from the larger community, and keep them to the citizens only
James B. - Desert District: 
And what is the purpose of this?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<div class="quote">like we would be looking at laws and de-facto levels of said freedoms in micronations.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Speaker, may I have the floor?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
You may proceed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
Political freedom and civil liberties are internal matters of the nations.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Mr. Roy of Vishwamitra.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Apology, If I took the subject in an other way
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe if nations would like to participate in this outside program they should contact to organization's directors directly
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would concur. I would like to point out that this not the first time an observer has proposed legislation: an act was proposed earlier this year by Mr Brienovich, for the Twin Town project.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Apology for that, I am not aware of that, due to our nation being a new member of the organization
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Matachewan is no longer present. Expect me to be back in around 30 minutes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any further comment?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from our end.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Now I would like to move to a more recent proposition.
Do any of the delegates present have any suggestions as to what our official vote tiebreaker procedure should be, or if we shall have one at all?
James B. - Desert District: 
I wholeheartedly concur.
LamentTwice: 
I have an idea, however I might have to look into it further.
Give me a few minutes.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'm aware of the current process, can someone tell me?
James B. - Desert District: 
Officially there is none I believe.
That’s the issue.

Do we have any comment on Mr Lycons voting amendment?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It seems fine to me.
LamentTwice: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Final call for any comment before we move on.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from our end.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Let us move on to the Cupertino Natural Interest Project.
Under the assumption we are all familiar with the project, let us discuss the projects criteria.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'm not aware of this also, apology for that.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
So, it implies to the natural area claimed by the member-nations right?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Oh alright, I read that in the announcement section, and it seems perfect for adoption and implementation
But how do we know whether the members are really doing it?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Photo evidence will be required to maintain their grade
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
What if an area is clean enough to not require having to clean 2 bags worth of items, let alone one?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That is a good point, I'll probably just say take a photo of the area to show that it is clean and no maintenance is required
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have anything further?
If not, let us proceed with the discussions mandated by the Great Repeal Act.

I do not think the Cayenne Declaration is needed at this stage of the alliance
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur with Mr. Xia
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with Mr. Xia
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia:

It's bit unlogical as well (the bill I mean)

This project never took off, presumably due to lack of interest or language speakers.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It was a good bill but no one knew any niche languages
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Ja.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd suggest the bill be adopted
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I know some Afrikaans.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Hain.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Goeie dag almal
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I don't understand, moreover, I'd suggest that myself and Mr. Roscoe maintain decorum.
James B. - Desert District: 
Cease please, this is not necessary.
LamentTwice: 
How about West Frisian?
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur with Mr.Roy; the project seems like a good idea to adopt by the Cupertino Alliance.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I disagree with Mr. Jamez.
LamentTwice: 
People do speak it, just not in this alliance.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We can have a cultural exchange project also.
Patrick Kenny: 
I know a little Norwegian but not enough to translate
James B. - Desert District: 
I meant the speaking in different languages mid-session Mr. Roy.
Not the bill.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Oh apologies, Mr. Jamez
James B. - Desert District: 
Not a problem.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
May I know which ministry would this bill fall under?
Do we have a culture related ministry?
LamentTwice: 
culture?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd suggest for a cultural exchange programme within the member-nations organized by CA, to enrich the knowledge of learning foreign languages.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Not to my knowledge.
Patrick Kenny: 
I would suggest a vote on which other languages people can read and write, and if there is a minority language that a lot of people know then we just adopt a secondary language
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I represent a nation which has variety of speakers on variety of languages.
Predominately, all Indo-Aryan languages
Patrick Kenny: 
But translating it into language no one knows fluently may be a waste as I am assuming we all know English relatively
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd also like to add a small thing to the bill, I don't know how effective it be.
<div class="quote">But translating it into language no one knows fluently may be a waste as I am assuming we all know English relatively
Patrick Kenny: 
If there is another language everyone knows than I think it would work, but if there is a base language we all understand I don’t see a reason just keeping that
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Every language is equal, you're an English speaker so it might seem to be easier for you.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
English is at present the lingua franca for the Alliance.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I dont' think that the bill proposes to have those languages be adopted as working language here
Patrick Kenny: 
I’m not saying English is above other languages, I’m saying that we all know English as we are typing it now, I see no reason change the system
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The bill does not propose to change the system, Mr. Kenny.
LamentTwice: 
I cannot speak a foreign language
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
May I add a small thing on the language related topic, I've noticed that Hindi version name of Cupertino alliance does not appear on the MW page
James B. - Desert District: 
They can’t get to every language.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thai? Why is it then?
Do we have Thai speaking nations?
James B. - Desert District: 
We did until Orientia dissolved.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I think it is just better to remove the other language titles in the ENG version of the MW page
James B. - Desert District: 
I am unaware of any remain.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Either, pls remove the entire section or add Hindi
I dont' know any Russian speaking nation here
Patrick Kenny: 
I would suggest we stick to a language everyone knows then we are playing if everyone’s strengths
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
How do that imply to my adding Hindi thing?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Anyone can edit MicroWiki pages
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I can update it for you in 5.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd do it, thanks, but I asked because we have a Minister responsible.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Matachewan is again present.
Patrick Kenny: 
I would suggest to the chair to have a survey on the languages delegates can understand for the wiki page
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I have a proposal, that is not related to this issue.
Patrick Kenny: 
I see
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
So we have any further comment before we move on to membership voting?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
None from me.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I call for a formal warning against Daniel Roscoe for this disgusting and vile joke.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
With due respect, that is a private matter for the chair to discuss with the supreme judge.
Patrick Kenny: 
Disgusting sounds a bit  rough and uncalled for
Bit extreme
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, I feel that we are not here to discuss such, as per the agenda.
Thank you.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I advise you take this matter to the chairman.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Apologizes for not reviewing that as I was not there during the conversation, punishment has been given.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Thank you.
Patrick Kenny: 
Not even that bad of a joke, may not be funny but “disgusting and vile” sounds a bit below the belt
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Alas, with that matter out the way, let us proceed to the membership votes.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
It is making fun of self-harm. It is definitely both disgusting and vile.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It was posted in an informal channel, and that post does not reflect any of my views.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<strong>Let us discuss the possible membership upgrade for Regelis.</strong>
Patrick Kenny: 
I don’t think it is making fun of self harm
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">I request the Ponderosean &amp; Australisian delegates to discuss the matter outside <span class="mention">#session-hall</span>
Patrick Kenny: 
Yes agreed this matter can be discussed outside
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I concur. Let us stay on topic.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm so sorry I'm having such a bad day today, I know this didn't happen today but still
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Valentinus, is the next topic on membership discussion?
James B. - Desert District: 
Yes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Yes.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I suggest that Regelis be promoted as a full member of the organization.
LamentTwice: 
I would definitely like to see Regelis become a full member.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
May I ask a question, Mr. Speaker?
James B. - Desert District: 
Regulis has shown great activity, suggestions to improve the alliance, and in general has contributed significantly in their short time here.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Roy, proceed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Is the Regelisian delegate, likely to be appointed as the Minister of Tech, as soon as promoted as full member?
James B. - Desert District: 
I would hope so but there’s no way of knowing.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That would be difficult for me to answer, as the Technology ministry is not yet formally established.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The Ministry was proposed after he designed the website
Patrick Kenny: 
I would vote to upgrade the membership, they show much initiative
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd something to speak, but would rather like to be on DM with the Chair or the Speaker.
Other than that, it's a yes from our end.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is it related to the current topic?

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd suggest that Eiru be accepted into CA, but I'd suggest that you might improve their foreign outreach.
LamentTwice: 
I concur with Mr. Roy
Patrick Kenny: 
Does the rules for membership say they need to be older than 6 months?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
6 months or features of a 6 month nation.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That used to be the case, but was amended to change the requirement to has the function/appearance of a six month old micronation.
Patrick Kenny: 
How does one judge that?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Subjective, delegates decide that
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Pls pardon me, was Australis six month old, when they're accepted as a member?
So, is a six-month mandate, deciding how efficient the member would be
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
They should be six months of age or have elements of a six-month old nation
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We were something like three months old with elements of six.
Patrick Kenny: 
Again I’m not sure how to judge that as a 6 month nation could be as stable as a 5 day one
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Nations existing for one year or more, have proved to be unstable.
Just as in case of VISSR
Patrick Kenny: 
And I’m not sure what the characteristics of a 6 month one is
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra:

To my knowledge, they have left the LIN/in the process of doing so.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Monmark is a decent nation, however they are known for a lot of primarily nobility hunting
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">Why does it matter if they are from Reddit?

Addison Dillon - Neptunia: 
I have no comments.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Then I shall abstain due to a heavy load of personal bias.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Noted.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
No comments here.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Alas, let us move on.
Patrick Kenny: 
Agreed
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Next up, Empire Huai Siao
Empire Huai Siao</div>

Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I support the entry of Huai Siao
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As per request, the delegate of Vishwamitra shall make comment on this potential member later.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur with Mr. Xia
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I just return from dinner, I'm present now.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Ah, welcome back.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I joined at the exact time
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I have no comment on Huai Siao.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd suggest that Huai Siao is accepted as a member-nation.
Adding to that, Huai Siao is a member of ASPAA
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I will be voting yes for Huai Siao.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Moreover, they're likely to fill in the place vacated by the dissolution of Orientia.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I will also be voting yes. It seems there is not much bad to be said about Huai Siao, not that I know of them.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
On the topic of Orientia, will Huai Siao not also be affected by the recent political events in Thailand?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am speak on that
I'd recently hold talks with the Prime Minister &amp; Prince Regant
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If they're an Asian nation I'm all for growth of that sector.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They're not much affected by lese majeste, and would suggest everyone not to mention on public platforms that they're from Thailand
Addison Dillon - Neptunia: 
My main problem with Huai Siao is that their constitution is not in English, but that may just be nitpicking. I'd vote yes in Huai Siao.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Orientia's leader's family had ties with the Thai royal inner circle
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
With all due respect, their remarks and public microwiki page blatantly state they are Thai.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
<div class="quote">My main problem with Huai Siao is that their constitution is not in English, but that may just be nitpicking. I'd vote yes in Huai Siao.
Yes, they're removing those, as told to me.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
They also bear Siamese symbolism, lest I be mistaken.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Nope, they don't use any Thai regalia or symbols
Their culture and tradition are based on the Empire of China
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Ah, I must have confused it. My apologies.
Patrick Kenny: 
Do they know English, in a texting capacity?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, ofcourse
Might be not as the other English speakers do.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I believe that their leader uses Google Translate to speak in English.
Patrick Kenny: 
I see no reason not to then
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Well, to the fact, is that I'm not an English speaker
I don't use translator also
Patrick Kenny: 
If it is understandable then I see then fit
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I don't think this will be a problem, as I can understand them.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, obviously, whenever I speak
He takes time in replying, as he translates those and replies back in English by translating it from Thai.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes, that was what I was referring to.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I understand.
Patrick Kenny: 
If it works, it works
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Ofcourse.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Any further comment?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
No comment from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from Vishwamitran side
Patrick Kenny: 
Non from Australis
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">They're not much affected by lese majeste, and would suggest everyone not to mention on public platforms that they're from Thailand
This can get us in legal trouble, and I would feel terrible if we got them in it.
My no vote protects them and us and I encourage others to do the same.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Howcome?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Their administration had looked into the matter, and then applied for CA.
I don't think we have to look into it.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Elaborate on us and legal trouble.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Orientia was dissolved out of another reason, please mind that
James B. - Desert District: 
They’re Thai.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
And?
James B. - Desert District: 
Seceding alone can get severe punishments.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Orientia was dissolved due to a personal matter relating to lese majeste to my knowledge.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I apologies for the thing I shared.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Wow.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I got to know it, exclusively from top Orientian officials
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Pun Watta? The man who played the internationale on  a recorder on YouTube?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Idk
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Hilarious.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Well, they're some more Thai nations
Micronationalism does not only mean that we're separatists
It also mean that we're promoting the culture and heritage
as we do in Vishwamitra.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
 as it contains potentially precarious information.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I apologies for the mistake that I committed, and request all others present here not to share it.
LamentTwice: 
^
Patrick Kenny: 
This seems complicated
A little to complicated
James B. - Desert District: 
I have a question for Mr. Valentinus that isn’t related to this.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any further comment before we move to the next member?
James B. - Desert District: 
If I could ask at the end of the session it’d be appreciated.
Patrick Kenny: 
I would like to change Australis vote to an abstain
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The membership vote is later, this is merely a reading.
Patrick Kenny: 
I see then
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I don't think that a nation being from Thai, should be a problem
Patrick Kenny: 
What’s next in the agenda?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Soyuzist Republic(ⵊⴰⵎⵀⵓⵔⵉⴰ ⵙoⵢⵓⵣ)
The Soyuzist Republic</div>
The Soyuzist Republic is a self declared country [a], also referred to as a micronation by external observers. It works on the basic principles of Soyuzism. The nation was established on 30 April 2020, by the founder and current Prime Minister Hicham Soyuz.</div>

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Speaker, may I?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Proceed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Soyuzist Republic, as described by the PM, is a political affiliation responsible to fight for rights of the villagers of Morocco. The nation is based in Morocco, but is ruled from Netherlands.
I'm the person responsible to develop their wikipage, so I was made to know that by the Prime Minsiter.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Do any other delegates have comment regarding the application of Soyuz?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Ruled from the Netherlands?
What?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This seems like a Bir Tawil thing
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They can be accepted, unless their being a political party is true
<div class="quote">This seems like a Bir
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Ah
Patrick Kenny: 
So are they a government in exile?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I thought he was just claiming some random piece of land
Patrick Kenny: 
Oh I see
Same
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Morocco has been described as a country with no opportunity and hence he stays in Netherlands for studies, and occasionally visits Morocco
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Well then, I don't know. I will vote no.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Does any of his government officials are in Morocco?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Another thing to add, sorry
Patrick Kenny: 
Sounds like a political movement
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Chair, DM again please
<div class="quote">Sounds like a political movement
Patrick Kenny: 
Are these backroom chats necessary? Isn’t this just a reading?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Backroom chats? what do you mean?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I presume the direct messages.
Patrick Kenny: 
I do
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That's bit important for me to directly inform the Chair, rest will be looked on by him.
Do we have any other nation on the list?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
Nouveau Louis.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Wait, is this the nation which recently announced independence from Atiera?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Would not reccomend their approval
and yes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Bias with the Honourable Delegate from Atiera?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
<div class="quote">Would not reccomend their approval
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd suggest that New Louis is given sometime to settle
They're very new as an independent nation
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
New Louis is barely a couple of days old.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
These nanonations are often very unstable
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
With due respect, they do not appear to have the relevant state of development for the alliance.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Too young, no constitution.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
So, are we continuing with this nation for the rest two readings?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur with the delgate from Pinelandia
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">So, are we continuing with this nation for the rest two readings?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Which it is not.
Patrick Kenny: 
Would vote no for now
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The vote would be held after two readings.
Moreover, is the principal representative on the server?
She did not even introduce herself and her nation
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Can anyone confirm if the delegacy is present?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I don't think she is in the server
No, she is not.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
She should be encouraged to be on the server, I suggest.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I don't believe so. But the fact that New Louis was under the crown of Atiera merely a couple of days ago should be enough to see it isn't established enough.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
I'd already made that point
And also, their independence nation was something like -
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
And be it noted, she has asked if New Louis could rejoin if things didn't work out, proving New Louis to be unstable.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Any further comment?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from our end.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
None.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
None.

I have not receive the remarks from the Minister
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Who's exactly the main delegate?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Miller and Mr Burdette are already members of delegacy for other CA nations.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Oh, so are they leaving Humberlea?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Mr Burdette will be the temporary delegate
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The delegates seem professional, but I'm not sure on the nation.
So I won't speak much.
James B. - Desert District: 
Mr. Burdette has attempted to take leadership positions in many nations so I’m not surprised.
Including my own.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I can concur, and have seen them performing such in many nations myself.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That's true, Mr. Burdette, also likes to make competition with others.
James B. - Desert District: 
He lost in a two person race 10%-90%, and there were ten votes. Only person who voted for him was himself.
I digress.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean theres my GUM chair election but okay.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
In that case, I'd vote in no for the nation
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Are we here to talk about the respectability of the Minister-President or the nation itself and what it stands for?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur, should be about the nation
James B. - Desert District: 
The Minister-President represents the nation so both should be taken into account.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Is their still time to be present?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Perfect timing Mr. Burdette
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
<div class="quote">The Minister-President represents the nation so both should be taken into account.
While not in practice, in theory.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would in fact be switching from Humberlea to Nordika.
But I must abstain from anymore comment
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The nation appears to be a tad.. undeveloped in my opinion.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
How come?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Any further comment?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Yes.
If not the minister can provide with remarks on time, I will.
Patrick Kenny: 
How long has the nation been formed?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
With the information I have available, I couldn't really go and tell someone all about Nordika, besides naming a few members of government.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
It was formed on May 20. 2019 and headed by Prince Ole Petter and his council of state including myself.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is this for the 1st or 2nd Principality?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Same thing.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I found that.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/2nd_Principality_of_Nordika">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/2nd_Principality_of_Nordika</a>
2nd Principality of Nordika</div>
The Principality of Nordika, officially the Second Principality of Nordika is a nation-project based within Norway from which it wishes to secede. Given it is constitutionally illegal to change the borders of Norway nor is it legal to let Norwegian nobility exist, Nordika's so...</div>
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
On June 29 I declared the deposition of the entire council of state without their consent, to which the prince would reply to me when we were eating a kebab once, that he didn't really care about Nordika.
I would declare myself head of state on that day and change Nordika's localised governance to globalised for preservation purposes.
Patrick Kenny: 
Seems too unstable and complicate and involves members already present in the chamber
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
You haven't even seen the remarks.
Wherein it will say in stable condition: yes
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd wish to hear on Nordika from others, and not from the persons involved.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Bear in mind I am not providing my opinions.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That's how readings are discussed, I presume.
You're, Mr. Miller.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
are a set of remarks for Nordika prepared?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I have not received any notice from Mr. Montan
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
You're the HoS of Nordika, so you'd obviously speak in favour of the nation being into CA
So, will Mr. Burdette, as he's the Minister-Prez.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Roy, have I once said that Nordika should join the alliance or expressed my support for it?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It's better for me, to keep my mouth shut. Thank you.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I am simply annoyed that there are no remarks ready on which you may base your opinions on.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
are the remarks ready for presentation?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I will switch from Humberlea to a Nordika delegate. I have already stated that.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any further comment?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Isn't a set of remarks required on every reading?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Only on voting
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Unfortunately, they are not available.
Patrick Kenny: 
Moving on?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, what do we have next?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe you had a topic?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Can we finish it soon?
There's a GUM quorum also
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If we don't hear from the delegate of Desert District, I shall conclude the session in ten minutes.
James B. - Desert District: 
Yes.
I believe that it was last session you stated a matter of concern you had couldn’t be stated and only could be said privately to the Chair.
At this time are you able to share any more information?
That is all.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Unfortunately I have not heard any new information on that matter, radio silence.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
?
James B. - Desert District: 
Very well.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I do not recall mentioning Vishwamitra?
Nevertheless, the session concludes in five minutes.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
You did, it's during our upgrade reading
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I made remarks. They are unofficial and I will not release them unless permitted to do so. But I made them to demonstrate the little amount of time that it takes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe it won't be necessary.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Can we end up the session?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
One minute.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
<div class="quote">I believe it won't be necessary.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
<div class="quote">I made remarks. They are unofficial and I will not release them unless permitted to do so. But I made them to demonstrate the little amount of time that it takes.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Pinelandia is present.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright, lets get started
An election is projected January 2021 to succeed the Chair position. During the last session optimization poll various questions were included to decide any changes were wanted in this election.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is present.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Tesforia is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Firstly, the question of Should nominees be able to declare party affiliation within the nation they represent with party approval? was asked, with 60% of respondents voting in favour of such change.
Would you agree to this change? Feel free to discuss.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I dont see how it is practical in this setting.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
We shouldn't limit what political candidates can do
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I'm personally against partisan politics in any nation, let alone an alliance.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This isn't an election within a nation, this is a multinational coalition.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I am against this change as partisanship isn't good
But I do want to hear the opinions of others
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Are we to prevent them from affiliating with a political party?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It is optional.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It is currently optional before this change?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
There are currently no party affiliations in elections of the alliance
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Let it be known, you do not represent a party. You represent a Cupertino Alliance member nation.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I agree to the opinion of Mr. Sertor Valentinus.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I agree as well.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Well I believe they should have the right to declare party affiliation, but I don't think it needs to be recognized by the alliance
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe that to be a good compromise.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Should for whatever reason party affiliation exist, how would it even work in an organisation of this structure.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I would infer regarding Mr. Xia's idea that it would be a de facto thing with it not being represented on the ballot or electoral graphics
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Atiera will be internmentently present.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
<div class="quote">I would infer regarding Mr. Xia's idea that it would be a de facto thing with it not being represented on the ballot or electoral graphics
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Is there any final discussion regarding this idea?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur with Matthew.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
None here.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I feel that most of us make our ideologies known anyway
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I'd like to reiterate that the endorsement of factionalism and bipartisan politicking is the wrong direction for the alliance, but besides that, I have no further comment.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Also, what electoral system will the election be held with?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That would be the next question
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Alright. My choice is the two-round system.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Otherwise let's move on
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
David and Tyler know that politics is what led to the decline of the LIN.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
What happened to the LIN?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
That's a story for another time.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Political differences led to conflicts.
<div class="quote">Alright. My choice is the two-round system.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
And then Monmark, Atiera and a few others withdrew because of said conflict.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Point of order let's move on
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I would prefer a system based off of approval voting but I would also like Instant Runoff Voting
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
On a second thought, i think 2 rounds will be much better.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
For purposes referential, here is the previous election. 
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Ranked-choice voting worked well for the LIN in our previous election.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
There were three electoral systems proposed, those being
There is also the approval system
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I do not think plurality voting will be good in this case, as there are too many candidates, and I do not think that any of them will get more than 50% of the vote, leading to a Chair that the majority of the Alliance voted against.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe instant runoff voting would be the best choice, and two round preferable to plurality voting
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe the two-round system is the optimum approach.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think that instant runoff voting is too confusing when the electorate is small (like this election), which leads to a tie being more likely.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
two round most probably the best option
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I concur with the Ponderosan Delegacy.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
That is a fair point.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
There are far too many candidates to use the plurality system.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It sounds like we have a consensus
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Otherwise let's move on
As two round is favourable here, there would be multiple elections
How long should voting be?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
48 hours.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I would say 2-3 days would be reasonable
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
3 days.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
2-3 days
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
2 days
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
1 week had the most votes but 2 / 3 days had popular support
If it was 3 days I would prefer opening on Friday and closing on a Sunday
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe each round should be three days each, adding up to close to seven days.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I concur
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I agree
Friday to Sunday
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright, if we did 3 day voting, should we start on a Friday, end on a Sunday, then the second round be the next Friday, etc?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe that would be the ideal voting period
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Would the second round start immediately after the first round ends?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
No.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I would prefer the rounds be back to back.
Or a one day break possibly.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yeah but weekend voting is preferable and we can't do 3 day voting with 2 rounds on 1 weekend
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
<div class="quote">Or a one day break possibly.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Otherwise, let's move on
The date of official nominations for Chair are yet to be opened. A large amount of users want it open 1 December, with some on early November and mid-December
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Mr. Lycon, may I have the floor to propose a bill?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Does it relate to the electoral process?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Ah we have not moved on yet
I will wait then
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright
<div class="quote">The date of official nominations for Chair are yet to be opened. A large amount of users want it open 1 December, with some on early November and mid-December
There has been a lot of interest and there is no loss for opening them early.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe it should be 1 December.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Most candidates have essentially self-nominated at this point, with the CESE even conducting polling pre-nominations.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with the honorable delegate from Monmark.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright then
When should nominations be closed? A majority do prefer 31 December
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" style="color: rgb(94, 197, 171); background-color: rgba(94, 197, 171, 0.1);">@Members</span>

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That's ample time.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe 31 December makes sense.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
31 December
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I agree
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
That does appear acceptable indeed. Perhaps we should also add a time to it, to prevent odd situations?
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
31.12.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe the 31st of December is a reasonable date
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Most likely 11:59PM EST
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
Hmm
Might I propose switching to GMT?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
UTC perhaps
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
It's a more worldwide standard, and less specific to American standards
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur with Liam.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur too
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted
Well it'll likely end on 5AM UTC at 1 January 2021
Would the proposed time be fine for delegates?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Noted.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
That time seems fine.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
fine for me.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Certainly.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I approve
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I approve.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I have no objections
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright then
What should be the requirements for nominating yourself for Chair? 
I personally prefer having no restrictions and letting the delegates choose who they think is best
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur that there should be no requirements now that I think about it
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Becoming a minister is harder than it seems, from my observation.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur with the Chair.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think there should either be no requirements or you should need a second, like seconding a motion.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Removing the current or past minister rule would be adequate in my opinion.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I concur with the delegate of Atiera. Many of the ministers have held office for many months, preceding the current term. To have a ministry as a requirement would massively narrow the nominee pool, which would serve no benefit besides disqualifying several talented newer members.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur with the Honorable delegate from Tesforia.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with the delegate from Tesforia and Pinelandia.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I agree.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I agree with the idea of having no restriction on who can run, it should be the choice of the delegates.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Alright. How much debates should be hosted and when should they be?
Majority wanted 2 or 3
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Maybe one or two sometime in January
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
2
I think
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
3 debates would be a bit too much.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It would depend on when the election itself is held.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
maybe two before the first round and another one before the second round?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">It would depend on when the election itself is held.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Two at the very maximum I say.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">maybe two before the first round and another one before the second round?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I do not believe two entire debates beforehand is necessary, rather I consider it excessive.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I would think one debate as a start , a poll, and a second debate in respond to the poll
Relating to the debate question when should the first round of elections be?
LamentTwice: 
Nova Troms&#248; present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mid January?
LamentTwice: 
Around January
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe 6 February would be good, first Friday of the month.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">Mid January?
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
<div class="quote">Doesn't leave much room for campaigning or debating tbh
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Late January
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Tbh has been widely used in session hall and is generally accepted here
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
To expand upon my previous statement, I believe 6 February is good because it gives a month and a few days for campaigning, while sticking to the days we have already planned for the first round.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">To expand upon my previous statement, I believe 6 February is good because it gives a month and a few days for campaigning, while sticking to the days we have already planned for the first round.
I would say 6 February for second round since the transition of power would be 15 February
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I concur
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
no objections from me.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
First round 29 - 31 and second 5 - 7?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes, that makes sense.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with the honorable delegate from Ponderosa Hills
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I agree on that the first round should be from 29th to 31st of January and the second round should be from 5th to 7th of February.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright then, 60% of respondents wanted individual delegate voting but 40% wanted single nation vote like they do in the GUM
Should we do individual or single nation?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Individual voting absolutely.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">I prefer individual as we already do it in <span class="mention">#archived-voting</span>-hall.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe Individual.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I think we should do single nation voting as it would grant equal representation to each member state.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Individual.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Individual voting, but encouraging nations to have the maximum amount of delegates.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It looks like we have a consensus
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Having individual voting will yield a higher turnout.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have a point of order regarding this topic.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You have the floor.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We have proposed many processes will fundamentally determine how this and future elections are run. Will the electoral process be officially codified?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes, this is just testing the waters of various ideas. A formal bill will be motioned soon.
Finally, should observers who have met all requirements of membership and voting but have not been promoted yet be allowed to vote?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Hmm
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I shall abstain from this.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
If they've met voting requirements they should be allowed to vote
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe they shan't be permitted. Despite meeting the requirements— they are still observers, not members.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It doesn’t make much sense to have observers vote in my opinion
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Well, I think that it would be fair for them to vote under the condition that they have met all requirements of membership and voting.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
They have not been approved as members by the diet, for the current period they are serving an observer role.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That's a fair point
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Also observers are admitted at a lower standard or are potential candidates for full membership
It doesn’t seem logical for these types of nations to have the right to vote if they were accepted with a lower standard or that only recently got voted in
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted
The final question would be about a campaign channel, when should it open and what restrictions should it have (i.e. posting every 6 hrs, etc)
will also be applied to such channel
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
It seems like a good idea.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe it should open as nominations close.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Its good to limit banter so messages don't get buried, but speech should be open for those running
I believe you can give all candidates a role that exempts them from slowmode
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Perhaps a one or five minute slowmode?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
That would be fair
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I kinda want it to be less of a talking channel to be honest
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Perhaps just only candidates have the ability to speak
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That would be in place.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur with the honorable delegate of Yu-Xia.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
+1
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright then, let's move on.
Earlier you wanted to motion a bill, feel free to do it now.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Alright

This bill proposal shall remove the requirement of a discord server for applying nations
This is due to the fact that many micronations do not use discord as their main platform for communication
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
How are they to contact us and attend sessions?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
They still must have a discord account
But a discord server will not be necessary
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Maybe but if they already have a Discord account then it would be easy to make a Discord server?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think that is a good idea.
Why is a Discord server necessary anyways?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I concur.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
<div class="quote">Maybe but if they already have a Discord account then it would be easy to make a Discord server?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
<div class="quote">Why is a Discord server necessary anyways?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I believe it makes it easier to check out the nation
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
As long as they have proof of a functional government they should not need a discord server.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I’ve been able to do sufficient remarks only with the use of microwiki page or a similar alternative
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
^
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Providing a discord server will become optional
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We are fundamentally an organisation focused around the discord platform. This amendment would in future hinder communication.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Point of personal privilege, I have to have lunch
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
We could require a microwiki OR a discord server.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Or just proof of a functional government.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
<div class="quote">We are fundamentally an organisation focused around the discord platform. This amendment would in future hinder communication.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Some people run their nations completely irl.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am fully aware.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Excuse me for using the term “irl”, I could not think of another sufficient term to use.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
What about in real life?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Like most microwiki sector nations have their legislature run entirely on discord.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What would the delegation of tesforia deem suitable proof of a functional government? We need to take this into account, as the remarks writers will need to carry out this survey for new members.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Possibly proof of laws being passed, and a constitution
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
On the latter matter, not all micronations possess a constitution.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Without a constitution we don't know how their government would work, without a declaration of independence they won't exist.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Many micronations have different and more archaic forms of a legal foundation, one example being a common law approach.
Nevertheless, I believe we are veering off track.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
<div class="quote">Nevertheless, I believe we are veering off track.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark never had a declaration of independence, yet I believe it is clear we exist.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean you have a constitution which can act as a declaration of independence
Nevertheless, let's move back to track
As some nations run on a brick and mortar basis, this could help more nations of that caliber to apply
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur

Lytera has stated they would be getting more active in the GUM but it seems like they have forgotten that they are a member in the CA
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I do not know of the amount of activity from those nations, so I will abstain for now.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I will vote in favor of this act.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe Qaflana should be added into the act. Despite partaking in the Noted project, their contributions to the Alliance, and Session Attendance has been... scant at best.

Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Sorry for my abscense.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have anything else on todays agenda?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
There are a couple things, hold on one moment.
Mr. Cameron Koeher did inquire me about redoing the Cupertino Alliance coat of arms, would Parliament be interested in taking such an offer?
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think our coat of arms is fine as it is.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I like our current coat of arms. Can we see the new design?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur with Tyler.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
He has just offered to re-do it, there has not been any pictures or details about the final design.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It would be preferable to perhaps obtain a preliminary design or outline before we consider this.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted. He has stated his clear opposition to the crest of our coat of arms.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Did the gentleman state why?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I'm not opposed to seeing new designs, but I'd like to see them before we vote to replace the current one.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Most likely because of the toque.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I'm oppose to replace the current coat of arms, for the moment.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It was a remnant of the past and represents our roots
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
The toque is a relic of Cupertino Alliance history! We can't get rid of it.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Exactly.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
For referential purposes, here are the current arms.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Let him redesign it but leave the darn toque...
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I don't know the significance of the toque but I do believe tradition is important.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted.
Otherwise, let's move on
Though the office of Lieutenant Chair is not term limited if I recall correctly, should we amend the Prime Minister Act to make it have elections?
Following up to the question, should the Lieutenant Chair's election be on the same ballot of all future Chair elections?
And should the Lieutenant Chair be the running mate of the Chair or should they  be elected separately?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe they should be elected seperately.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
<div class="quote">Following up to the question, should the Lieutenant Chair's election be on the same ballot of all future Chair elections?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe they should be elected separately.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur with the Honorable delegate from Aswington, was about to say the same
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think they should be elected separately
LamentTwice: 
I also concur, as I plan to run for Lieu. Chair
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
We should elect the right person to the right position, not elect a pair and hope it aligns.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I concur with the New Athenian delegate
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
could chair and vice chair run a common campaign as in the US elections? Just a thought.
SuperGuy1119: 
Interesting idea.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">could chair and vice chair run a common campaign as in the US elections? Just a thought.
SuperGuy1119:

Exactly.

I believe the Lt. Chair position should be elected seperately
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Responding to the delegacy of Georgienstine: Unofficially perhaps.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark is no longer present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I'll most likely veto the idea of a party affiliation if Chairs are allowed to endorse Lieutenant Chairs etc
Any final discussion regarding the Lieutenant Chair idea?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from I.
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">And should the Lieutenant Chair be the running mate of the Chair or should they  be elected separately?
To have so very many elections is just confusing.
And if the two are appointed together there will be fewer issues in them working together.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The separate system could lead to something like the runner up Vice Presidents in US history
Which could lead to tension in Government
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
This is unrelated, but what if the CA had an entity similar to the Security Council of the UN?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I don't think we need that right now, but it'll be discussed later.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Alright.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Anyways, is there any final discussion regarding the idea of changes to the Lieutenant Chair?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from me.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Otherwise, let's move on to Mr. Montan's idea of a Security Council in the CA
Now I think this had been tested in the GUM and OAM back in 2010
What will the Security Council function as opposed to Parliament?
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="yeah!#3712">@Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills</span>
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
It could be like a council of all of the Ministers, for executive purposes- somewhat like a Cabinet.
And it does not have to have the title of Security Council.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What would its purpose be?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
^
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
To be something like a Cabinet, but more active.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
What would it do?
Would it be like a banner?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
What do you mean by a banner?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Like something with a logo and stuff but doesn't do much
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I guess.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I don't see the purpose then
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
My plan was for it to be something like China's Council of State.
State_Council_of_the_People%27s_Republic_of_China</div>
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I do not see why it need exist.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Otherwise, let's move on
2 ministerial positions are being switched or vacant, being Homeland Security or Public Affairs. Tyler M. of the Free Nation of New Athens is being considered for Public Affairs, but he currently has a bachelor's degree in Cybersecurity and am currently working towards a master's degree.
Would Parliament prefer Tyler being in Public Affairs or Homeland Security, or both (unlikely)?
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
what's his own preference?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe this should be the choice of the honorable delegate from New Athens
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
He thinks he would be better for Homeland Security.
<div class="quote">I believe this should be the choice of the honorable delegate from New Athens
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I'm more qualified for Homeland Security because of my degree in cyber security and experience in cyber crime law but I believe I could perform well in either position.

If you see yourself more in the Homeland Security position a decision is made then I think.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Can I get clarification on the duties of the Minister of Homeland Security?

Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
What remains on the agenda?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
One more topic then any final private member's bills and then memberships
On April we made some seals for the then-pre-existing ministries. Some Ministers have been brining up making logos for their ministry as some agencies have them.
They were finished under the PNG format. <a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/File:Ministerasiancupertino.png">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/File:Ministerasiancupertino.png</a>

Alexander I Constantine-Monmark:

There has also been a prototype design based on the Investigative and Domestic Enforcement command, using a coat of arms style with colours of the USPS <a href="https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/520994444036669440/770344322411266068/unknown.png">https://cdn.discordapp.com/attachments/520994444036669440/770344322411266068/unknown.png</a>
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I have no objection about that. Looks good.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
It looks good.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Finally, we could use the Ministry text used in the guides
The third option would take the least amount of time.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Either is good
In my opinion at least.

Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I like the third option
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I would prefer the latter
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I prefer the third option.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Would the new symbols be applied to the positions lacking such, or will all ministries receive updated signage?
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
The third option.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Most likely all ministries
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would opt for the first or second option.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
However, if we were to adopt the text option, we should adopt some form of distinguishing feature such as colour, similar to the British Government departments.

Have they ratified the charter and mission?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
As they filled in the form, it is assumed but it can't be verified at this time.
This is a old guard micronation so it could lead to an improvement of old guard relations
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I am strongly in favor of Nemkhavia joining.
An old guard nation will boost the reputation of the CA by a <strong>lot.</strong>
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I strongly support their application, we work closely in the IMC. A trustworthy nation.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I support their application too.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I support their application.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
At a glance, they appear to be suitable candidates. I have not encountered them in the international sphere as of yet, so I cannot speak from a first hand account of them.

James B. - Desert District: 
I’ve heard nothing but good things regarding them.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I did not hear of them before, I abstain
James B. - Desert District: 
So unless something I am at this time unaware of comes up, I am in favor of their joining.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am not too sure about them. As noted in the last session, there is very little information regarding several aspects of the nation, further echoed in the remarks. Can we be assured this nation fulfils the requirements of six months development?
James B. - Desert District: 
They seem to have the characteristics.

Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I shall vote abstain once more, as Monmark has relations with them, however, they are not Cupertino Alliance worthy yet in my opinion.
Their original claims were simulationist, however they have changed them.
Now I am unsure of their situation, so I abstain for now.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I abstain
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe they are far too young to become a Cupertino Alliance member state
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I abstain.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Also I think their constitution could use a lot of work
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
They are well developed now at this point for a nation that is barely one month old, but what hurts their case is exactly that.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I agree with Mr Matthew Xia in both points.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
They seem to be on the right track but they're far too young and underdeveloped as of right now

An Italian micronation is a very nice touch, and their wiki is spectacular. Additionally, they seem to be well-developed.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As such, I don't see it necessary to have party affiliation.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Political parties make it Me vs. You. I see no need for that mentality.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
This is an intermicronational organization and not a micronation; why would we need them?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It's far and good if the elected representative remain non-partisan
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Humberlea is present, even though it is 4:30 AM here.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with Mr. Kummel
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
However, when it comes to party affiliation within their home nations, that becomes an issue of sovereignty, especially since most of us here are partisan-level politicians.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with Mr. Burdette and Mr. Kummel.
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
Not being able to affiliate while chairperson would only complicate politics back home.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
I think forming political parties here is a bad call, but not being able to affiliate with politics in your home nation is also a bad call.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
So here's my take: Political parties/affiliation are not necessary within the Alliance, as it overcomplicates the Alliance and divides us.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with Delegate Roscoe.
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
Within the alliance, yes. We still should be able to participate in national politics, though.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur and suggest we move on to the next topic, as we have reached a consensus.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree.
Our next topic of discussion is Electoral system changes to the Chair. (e.g. Plurality, two round, instant runoff)
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
What do we currently use?
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
The Delegation of Millania will not support any system not involving a STV-like system.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I also like the STV system.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
According to an act I read, for the Chair election I think it's a proportional.
Yeah, STV/proportional
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Pardon me, why do we need a proportional representation system?
It's an organization, however, we function more like a State
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Because an act states that is the method.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The system can be as simple, the nations vote for the candidate, and however wins selects the cabinet.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KbBChNOtxlmQePpF3IasUnujVcDOEdX-MEsfpQrIpns/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1KbBChNOtxlmQePpF3IasUnujVcDOEdX-MEsfpQrIpns/edit</a>

...If there were 3 or more candidates, use a single transferable vote.
Article 2
We currently have five candidates.
I feel that this system would be effective.
Any opinions on this topic?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra won't be present for a while, I'd be back soon.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Alright then, lets move on
Next topic: How long should Chair elections be?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would say a week would be adequate time.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur, or until all delegates have cast their vote.
If that occurs.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I doubt it will.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Is there any other discussion on this matter?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Not from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright
When should nominations be closed?
As you know, official nominations open on 1 December.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
The end of December maybe.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I would suggest perhaps something like Christmas Day.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Possibly.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As the election will likely be occuring in mid January.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur with Mr. Roscoe.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Give the delegates about 3-4 weeks from official opening of nominations.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That would be plenty of time.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree
Sorry for pauses, I'm writing minutes.
Okay, no further communication on this matter?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I have no further comments.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright.
How should we vote? (i.e. Delegate or by nation)
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
By nation
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
By delegate since each delegate is a member of parliament.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I personally think that we should vote by delegate. That way, each individual member gets a say. One person may agree with someone's campaign, whereas another will not.
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
It would not be fair because some nations have multiple delegates.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Delegate Mill&#225;n raises a good point.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">It would not be fair because some nations have multiple delegates.
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
I think that having a nation simply send in more people would skew the electorate.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
<div class="quote">It would not be fair because some nations have multiple delegates.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
An example of this is Lycon and Efton, they both represented Aenderia.
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
Some nations here are not willing to send a full embassy.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Why would a nation not be willing to send 3 delegates to represent them?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
At the end of the day, as Burdette said, each delegate is a member of Parliament and should be allowed a vote each.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Also what if all the delegates of a nation want a different candidate?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with Mr Burdette.
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
Different nations have different motives for participation in this organisation.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
We could make it both, head of state for the nation gets a vote and so does each delegate.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present for a while
What's the issue discussed now?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Should each delegate vote or should the nation vote?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
How we will vote in the 2021 Chairman elections.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
There should be one vote per nation
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">We could make it both, head of state for the nation gets a vote and so does each delegate.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Some nations have 2 delegates, some have 3, some have one.
So, the vote shall be based not on number of delegates, but on the nation
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As for us, we've 2 delegates however, some have three delegates.
We should implement this for the membership vote also. One nation, one vote
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
A lot of delegates ARE the head of state.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I disagree.
I have a thought that may solve this.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The primary delegate (mostly the HoS) should vote
The othr delegates should not be allowed to vote.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Perhaps we could average out the amount of delegates each member state has, and the average number should be the amount of votes a member state can have.
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
Either that or a majority vote of the entire delegation which can be arranged from nation to nation
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Why don't we make it simple? One nation, one vote
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
some nations can use STV, some can use mutual consensus, some can simply vote
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't see why nations without 3 delegates can't just appoint new ones.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Could I quickly point something out?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">Why don't we make it simple? One nation, one vote
For example Ross wants to vote for himself, whereas Zarel wants to vote for me.
And both are members of the Aenopian delegation.
<div class="quote">Could I quickly point something out?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The GUM has a better electoral system then.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Most delegates here are saying delegates and not nations because they are just delegates, not the nation.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The vote should be based on the nation
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Lokin has the floor, let him speak.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
This small internal bias inside of the delegates head could make it so they get to vote, which is why I think only nation leaders should decide on this.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with Lokin.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Ministers could be a exception possibly though.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The delegates represent the nation.
And not individuals.
I and Stefan are representatives of Vishwamitra, so the vote would be on behalf of Vishwamitra &amp; not individual
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I still believe it should be up to each individual delegate.
Nicol&#225;s Mill&#225;n - Millania: 
The chief delegate should make an informed decision.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur with Mr. Mill&#225;n.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
What about each nation can make the decision for themselves?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I disagree I think Parliament should decide, in which each nations is tasked with producing 3 parliament members if they decide to not appoint three they can deal with the consequences.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">I disagree I think Parliament should decide in which each nations is tasked with producing 3 parliament members if they decide to not appoint three they can deal with the consequences.
Will there be any more discussion on this topic?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I have stated my opinion on the matter, so no more from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'll move on, then.
Next topic: Should voting results be public? How?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Before we move on, could I state something quickly?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Now, what I think is meant by this is results in the way of how elections show real time results.
<div class="quote">Before we move on, could I state something quickly?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Isaiah also holds a seat in Humberlean parliament.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That statement is incorrect.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Okay.
Please leave this now until the end.
Should voting results be public? How?
<div class="quote">Now, what I think is meant by this is results in the way of how elections show real time results.</div>
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I see no reason to keep them private as long as we do not mention who voted for who.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Is there any other debate on this topic?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
None from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next topic then: Should observers be allowed to vote?
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes, seeing as this election could potentially change the alliance.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe that observers are members of the Alliance, just like full members, and as such should be able to vote.
Bear in mind we may have multiple new members at the time who would want a vote on the matter.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
No I don't think Observer's should be aloud to vote as they are not in Parliament.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Observers, should get to vote for the election of the Chair at least.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
All new delegates start as observers - say they can become full members one week after the election - They'd have missed out.
As such, observers should be able to vote.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Parliament should elect the Chair so I will stay on my stance of Observer's not being able to vote.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Any further comment?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from our end.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Understood.
Next topic
How many debates should we have? When?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Maybe 2.
1 every 2 weeks.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd never seen debates for election of Chair of an organization.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree that we should have two debates.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Ban ki-moon did never sit for a debate with Vaire-Vike Freiberga before becoming the SG, UN
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This isn't the UN.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Pardon me, but it's an intermicronational organization.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And such debates would be beneficial in letting voters decide who to vote.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Debates are beneficial at national levels, I don't see such grand election is necessary at an intermicronational organizational level
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Macronational organizations tend to have member states who have major reason for voting someone. This isn't as much necessary for intermicronational organizations.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We'd also have reasons for voting someone.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't see why debates won't be useful. Would it not give candidates a time to mention their plans and defend it from criticism?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Debates are vital for getting plans across, and they're more attracting than regular campaigns.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would stick to my point, debates are not useful for elections in an intermicronational organization
State &amp; an organization are completely different
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This is an intermicronational organization.
So you agree?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am aware of that, Mr. Roscoe
Even I am telling that for a while
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">I would stick to my point, debates are useful for elections in an <strong>intermicronational organization</strong>
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Typing mistake
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Why don't you think they will not be useful. Having debates does not make it a Grand Election.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As the trend's going on, the election has been deemed equivalent to the Grand Indian General Elections 2019 or the Grand Presidential elections in US 2020
Can we move to the next time on the agenda?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You have not answered Mr. Burdette's question.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'm saying a point that it's just time consuming, intergovernmental organizational elections don't have debates, etc.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The nation's would vote on how the candidate would be able to function &amp; lead.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Okay.
Shall we move on now then?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Yes.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next topic: What rules should be implemented for the campaign and debates?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'm in favour of campaigning
I'd seen that some have declared their manifestoes, it's fair enough.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
No vulgar language
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Delegates should not launch attack campaigns, or other similar initiatives likely to damage a delegates reputation/cause divide within the Alliance.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur with Mr. Roscoe
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Such 'attack campaign's' have the ability to also interfere with member-to-member relations
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Another thing, I wish to add, if I have the chance, I'd love to.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Sure.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Might be bit away from the topic. 
For eg - Suppose we don't vote for Roscoe, who's nation is a close ally of Vishwamitra, it does not mean that our relation is going to end.
Pardon me, that was only an example
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That was never to be the point, but at the end of the day, that's an external factor.
And the Alliance can't really handle external matters, as it's out of hands
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It's because some candidates might take it personal.
It's well and good if that does never happen
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Well the deal with votes is that they are confidential.
Don't ask don't tell policy basically
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Understood.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any further comments?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Should Cupertino Alliance rules be required to be enforced in candidate’s channels?
I think that as campaign servers are relating to the CA, they should.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Will the candidate's channels be on this server? or separate servers?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Servers.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
So, that would become an external issue, however it's not bad if the rules are enforced
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Humberlea is no longer present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Is only Australis &amp; Vishwamitra attending this session?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It is a Cupertino Alliance relating server, and as such should be linked to the rules.
<div class="quote">Is only Australis &amp; Vishwamitra attending this session?
However, Mr. Munroe, the only delegate with a server for his campaign, has already stated this:
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Pardon me, I don't see a thing in which the entire Parliament is vacant, and the speaker is on the chair, and the deputy speaker sitting beside the vacant seat of the LoP
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">Pardon me, I don't see a thing in which the entire Parliament is vacant, and the speaker is on the chair, and the deputy speaker sitting beside the vacant seat of the LoP
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Then it's fine.
I am supportive of having the same rules on the individual servers.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Let me write such down in the minutes.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, next topic
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd seen that minutes are released only during the Asian session.
That makes this unique
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm hoping to get minutes written for sessions, you see, as it provides a good record of information without the Gazette.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Anyway, next topic, finally an act.
Second reading: Act to Amend Chapter 1 of the Charter Act

Any comments?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur as well. This is a limiting factor.
Many nations are quite brick and mortar, without Discord servers.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, I had to create one for joining Cupertino Alliance.
We never required one, because of the fact that most things happen in real life.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any further comments?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from our end.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Understood.

I concur with said act, as the nations in question have had extremely limited presence during sessions.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I also concur with his act.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The last time Millania was present was on the 17th of October, and that was just for saying they were present, no further comments in that session.
Before that was the 30th of September.
Also for one message
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They're present today
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And again 6 days prior, for one message.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Nicholas had spoken during today's session
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The trouble is that that was their first major presence since APRIL.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They're some nations who never spoke, I believe.
What about Lytera?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Last spoke here during JULY.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Kingdom of Bepistan, I never heard of them or from them
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And the Daragonian delegate isn't even here anymore!
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe, such nations should be expelled
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Efransa last made an appearance during August.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe Efransa's delegate is also a Minister?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The trouble is they're also a minister.
Which is even more problematic for their absency
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
At least the Ministry should be assigned to someone else.
What's the work on that ministry?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Basically PR.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I see, more like the Press I believe?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Should Naveria apply and be full members in time, I would be interested in seeing them contest the position.
I've discussed with their leader Casper, we're basically best friends
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
There are more members who're older than Naveria present as member with empty hands
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">There are more members who're older than Naveria present as member with empty hands
I will not be appointing anybody, the people shall decide.
Alas, we're off  topic.
Any further contributions?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Okay.
Second reading: Motion for Mr. Koeher’s request to redo Cupertino Alliance coat of arms
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
The arms shall be changed
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I also concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Can we move to the next topic?
I don't believe we need a discussion for this.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yep, was just writing minute info.
Should the Prime Minister Act be amended to require the Lt. Chair to be elected?
I would actually be inclined to disagree.
Instead, I think that the Lt. Chair should be decided via a running mate with the chair, similar to the US system.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am not aware of this act at large, can you please give me an introduction?
I am against that. Elections should be there for the Lt. Chair.
I am also supportive of your idea of individual elections, rather than selection.

<div class="quote">I am also supportive of your idea of individual elections, rather than selection.
Say for example, you theoretically are my running mate, and I win, you also automatically become CA Lt. Chair. This would allow for easier cooperation.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The election can be at the same time, however, having separate election would be better.
In that case, we can vote for the two on the basis of their credibility &amp; not only on the Chair-candidate's
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The running mate system has seen successful implementation within the GUM, a 10+ year old organization.
<div class="quote">Aenopia is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But the system is likely to change in GUM.
Matthew S. made a proposal yesterday, I believe you can see.
And yes, we can't fully depend on GUM's system
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur, but if it ain't broke, don't fix it as they say.
Any further comment?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would like to state that by keeping the seats separate, it opens up more opportunities for individuals to have their say.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Is that all on the matter?
Next topic is basically the same as the last; How should the Lt. Chair be elected? Through being the Chair’s running mate or separately?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes; and separate
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe as the Chair's running mate.
It'd be funny to see a Roscoe Valentinus campaign.
But also powerful.
Alas, I am biased on this one.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Well, if that happens, it'd be interesting to see who's Roscoe's running mate or Valentinus' running mate
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any further comments?
Alright lets move on.
Proposed Security Council of the CA by Leon Montan
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with that.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
What would be the point of it though?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe it could act as salami tactics.
Slowly removing sovereignty/independence of nations, if this has the power to interfere with internal affairs.
As such, I'm against such a proposal.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
salami?
It means salute in Hindi

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
<div class="quote">Haha
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I noticed, and I made sure to correct myself, Mr. Roy.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I don't believe the formation of the SC will hinder with the sovereignty of the members.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Well, we would need further clarification by Mr. Montan.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It'd deal with matters related with the security of the org. I believe
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Hasn't a a similar topic been discussed before?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think so.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I don't recall, maybe it happened before I joined
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It was after.
However, any further comment?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from our side.

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Was this act not discussed earlier?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe this act should be passed, with the addition that it should potentially be merged with Ministry of MicroWiki Affiars.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">Was this act not discussed earlier?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright.
No, I'd definitely discussed that in October
I'd also proposed a merge of the MW ministry
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yep, as I said, first reading.
This is the second.
Some acts get forgotten about and later brought back up.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But a similar one was discussed even before Regelis became a full member
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It was, and you're correct.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
So was that the first reading?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
But seeing as we are all at consensus here, shall we move on?
<div class="quote">So was that the first reading?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Revival of Cupertino Alliance ministerial insignia
I agree, the current logos are sorely in need of replacement.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, I also concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
For example:
it could definitely be reworked, also to include Oceanian in the title.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, also the dragon can be edited at large
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You get my point.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The white outlines are visible
All logos needs to be edited.
Our second delegate is good at those.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Any further comment
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted. Let me just do some minute stuff, won't take long.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra:

Revival of Cupertino Guide project
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe that'd help new members to join?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And for the general development of micronations.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That's good. We've a lot of newer nations here, so I believe it'd help them to develop
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Any further comment?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, on our next topic then.
Discussion: Proposed CA-GUM recommendation system
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
What's that?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The Cupertino Alliance is considering the possible acquisition of the Joining the GUM agency, considering it is inactive, and is also considering the adoption of a recommendation system for GUM applicants as a replacement to the agency. I, personally feel like that would be best for both parties. We are currently looking for opinions for this idea and if there is enough support I will propose it to both CA Parliament and GUM Quorum. I've talked with Cristi, Leon, and Zarel regarding the idea and they all support it.
I think that this initiative is a good idea.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I've been asked by Cristi to join as an active official in HJG
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It makes us look inferior to the GUM and more like a stepping stone though.
I support the idea of a HJCA (It was part of my manifesto) though.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
He acknowledges my experience, which is not done by all
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah, I was going to add on that the GUM must do a vice versa as well.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I don't think GUM needs to do a vice-versa
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As Ross said, it makes us look inferior.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't think the GUM would want to do a vice-versa anyways.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It remains to be seen.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with Ross' last statement
The GUM administration is not likely to do a vice-versa
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Okay. Any further comment?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Feedback on polling for the 2nd Cupertino Alliance chairmanship election
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
No comments from Vishwamitran side
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe that the polling is a good feature, and that it should continue.
A new poll after each has finished to gain statistical data.
No further comments, let's move on.

Now, this is an interesting act.
Has bright potential.
has the floor to discuss their act.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I lay the bill on the table of the House, Mr. Speaker
I'm ready to answer any question.
A similar proposal was wholeheartedly accepted in GUM and it was made by me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Would you like to discuss how this would be implemented/purpose?
Who would keep it up-to-date?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes sure.
I won't be able to be online for much long. 
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Sounds like a good act. I'm in support of it.
would you like to attend so that we don't end up dying during this session?
Onto the next topic

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I mean it's fairly self explanatory really.
You've been trusted with access to a private area, so if you leak it there should be consequences.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that nations that leak information from private areas should lose said privilege for a predetermined amount of time.
Deending on the offence of course.

Any comment on Nordika?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their Microwiki page is incredibly vague.
I've seen them before but I can't determine much from their page.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe I confused this with another Scandinavian sounding micronation.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Since when did Australis sign a treaty with Nordika?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There is hardly any information about this one at all.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm incredibly confused.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Are you sure you did?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Well it's not in our records.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes.
It relates to Nordika.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
My apologies for my interjection.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
All good.
I've never signed a treaty with Miller or Burdette.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Well if the nation has been lying about their foreign affairs then it's just reason to oppose their application.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Perhaps my Foreign Minister did without informing me? I'll check in with them.
I believe they mistook a diplomat pass for a treaty. I'll contact them later.

I would be highly in favour of their membership.
They are certainly an old guard nation, and it could pave the way for more old guard nations to join in the future.

They have clearly shown professional conduct on this server and the GUM.

Far to young in my opinion.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Their application seems to be very bare, and they are younger than six months old, and don't exhibit characteristics of a six month old nation.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It would appear their lineage extends back to 2018, under InfinityLand.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They're apparently in a civil war right now which brings up questions about their stability.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thank you
A complaint against Smtih had been issued on October 2020. Parliament passed the Judicial Confidence Act later and since the Roy affair had been recently ended, I had spoken to the delegate today regarding the complaint, and later, had advised me to hold a vote of no confidence against Smith. I had spoken with Smith after and he made a statement
LamentTwice: 
I do believe you have made a spelling mistake involving Mr. Smith’s surname
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. It is true that I have made a complaint regarding Zarel Smith being anti-Semitic, and I stand by this complaint, and am calling a motion of no confidence against the secondary delegate from Aenopia, for his gross remarks regarding Jewish people.
If it is necessary, I will post my evidence of this claim here.

I am a Jew. I have faced some discrimination in micronationalism due to it. I spoke to Zarel regarding these messages a few weeks ago. He genuinely was sorry, and I know  him well enough to know he wasn’t lying when he apologized. People screw up. People are fighting battles that you don’t know. To make a vote of no confidence for a few innapropiate jokes that he has apologized for, is excessive and not helping anything.
We all screw up, we’ve all done something like this even if we don’t want to admit it.
I encourage others to forgive Mr. Smith.
Thank you.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe that if Zarel Smith were to issue a formal apology we should forgive him and move on
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I do not think that his apology was sincere. He has made comments that I believe are backing my claim <strong>today.</strong>

With all due respect how was I being anti-Semitic in that pic?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Montan.. this post appears to implict you posting animal abuse?
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">Mr Montan.. this post appears to implict you posting animal abuse?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur with the Yu-Xia delegation, however, I believe he should show himself not making comments of said nature for a set time.
&#92429;lͥunͣaͫ &amp; &#120284; &#119812;&#119834;&#119853; ᴛᴜɴᴀ ❦: 
Well that is true and he did post such material, this is not relevant to our current discussion
James B. - Desert District: 
I could go out and search off-color jokes you some of you have made, you are just lucky you haven’t been caught. Give Mr. Smith a break.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
The material that is in question I believe was fake, but if it is real, I will apologize for it. It was a shock video of an extremely large pig doing questionable activities, and due to the sheer size of the pig, I did not believe it was real.
James B. - Desert District: 
Are you trolling right now Mr. Montan?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
No.
James B. - Desert District: 
So you expect us to accept your apology.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I inform Parliament that Aenderia will be present intermittently.
James B. - Desert District: 
But you refuse to accept Zarels?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Given the very nature of this, I am unsure as to why we have broke from precedent of the upper echelon conducting an investigation.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Atiera is currently present
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur with the honorable delegate from Pinelandia.
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Recently there was a discussion about David of Eiru making fascist statements with an agreement not to let him join the alliance therefore. Shouldn't we treat all these incidents the same?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe those claims were retracted
And Eiru was still voted upon, but denied if I remember correctly
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
I remember their application not being approved, I had a conversation with David directly after.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any comment regarding the proposed motion of no confidence?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Well it was denied by vote, rather than executive decision
James B. - Desert District: 
I think a vote shouldn’t even happen.
Is anyone else  besides the honorable delegate from Ponderosa Hills in favor of a vote?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I am.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I remind delegates that Montan will require 2 more signatures before proceeding to a vote; this is just a discussion as of right now
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
A person with such power should not be making comments like this.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I will bring the vote into further consideration, and will soon release an apology regarding the video.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Anything further on this particular topic on the agenda?
James B. - Desert District: 
Again.
Why are we expected to accept your apology.
You won’t accept others.
You’ve created a double standard.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
It is for the better we move on. Let's try to be productive and not argue during a session. We are discussing the proposed vote of no confidence of Mr Smith, not arguing with the Honorable delegate from Ponderosa Hills.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Anything final regarding this motion?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Again, I think that the apology of Mr. Smith was insincere, and I thought that it was not real.
William Cooper - Galte: 
Might I be permitted to ask a question?
James B. - Desert District: 
I could say the same about you.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Mr Jamez, quit it. please. All I ask of you.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
you have the floor.
William Cooper - Galte: 
Am I allowed to vote?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Point of order, you are an observer and hence you can not vote.
I yield the floor back to the speaker
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe it is in best interests to move on.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Mr speaker, may I ask how we sign such motion?
William Cooper - Galte: 
I would like the record to reflect that I would have added my signature given the opportunity.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Mr. Munroe, speak to the applicant of such bill.
I yield the floor back to the speaker
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Thank you Mr Lycon.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
For those inquiring about signing, please speak to The Honourable Leon Montan.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe not, this is an alliance, it should not be corrupted by partisanism.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur with the Honourable delegate from Monmark
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe it should be allowed but it won't be recognized by the alliance.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Tesforia is present, only partially though.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
William Cooper - Galte: 
I would say to the honourable delegate that it is my belief that party affiliation is not neccessarily an evil. It can be a useful tool to spread one‘s message and to represent one’s ideals.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Fair point, however, outside of individual nations, it serves no purpose.
William Cooper - Galte: 
From the platform of an organized entity one can achieve more than by oneself.
James B. - Desert District: 
One shouldn’t really be putting politics into their leadership as Chair.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Co-operation should be encouraged, not partisanism.
William Cooper - Galte: 
This is a political union, is it not?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think we should be able to have teams of such but not political parties.
James B. - Desert District: 
No, it’s a development org.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
A Chair should represent the whole alliance, not just their party.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Political parties can interfere with the process of development
William Cooper - Galte: 
Assuming we have a good system of electing the chair, they have gotten to that point by representing a majority of the alliance.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Anything further, or shall we proceed?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
What of the minority though? Their voices shan't be silenced in the name of the majority.
William Cooper - Galte: 
Of course not, but even without parties, there will always be people who don’t vote for someone.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Fair point.
No further discussion from Monmark.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Let's move on.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I shall present the next discussion.
I would like to discuss proposed electoral changes to the chairmanship elections.
The current system calls for first-past-the-post with up to 2/3 candidates, with a 2-round system in place for larger numbers.
James B. - Desert District: 
I would like ranked choice voting.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe the more democratic and more representative system would be instant runoff.
William Cooper - Galte: 
It is the postion of Moletopia that for the preservation of democracy, and ease of vote tallying, that instant runoff voting is the ideal compromise.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur with both delegates
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think only due to the amount of candidates we have, It may be better to use the 2 round system.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
William Cooper - Galte: 
If that’s the case then with AV it may only take 2 rounds anyways.
Why waste this opportunity to make positive change for the future because we may not need it in the present?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have anything further? If not, we can move another point of discussion about the chairman elections.
William Cooper - Galte: 
I may have to take my leave or at the very least be more sporadic in my checking of discord.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Next discussion.
How long should the elections last for?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I'd say 3 days (Friday - Sunday)
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
2 days
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur with the chair.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur with the honorable delegate from Aenderia.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I also concur with the Honorable chairman
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is this under the assumption there are two rounds?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
May I suggest an alternative to Instant Runoff and Universal Suffrage?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do proceed.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
No
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe that an approval voting system would be the most ideal system, as it allows delegates to cast a vote for every candidate which they approve of.
In Yu-Xia we have done a couple elections using the approval rating system and it has worked well for us.
The premise of this voting system is quite simple as well.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Any further comment on either points?
If not, let us continue with the next nitpick: when should the nomination period be closed?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
31 December seems reasonable.
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">I believe that an approval voting system would be the most ideal system, as it allows delegates to cast a vote for every candidate which they approve of.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Mr. Lycon
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur with the chair.
James B. - Desert District: 
I also concur with the honorable delegate from Aenderia.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur with Mr Lycon.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
<div class="quote">I’m not familiar with this system.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We have moved on to nomination period closure.
Final call for comment.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I think we should move on.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I'll take that as a 'no'.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I am now present I apologize had a meeting with a cryptocurrency dev team.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I personally believe no requirements other than being a delegate should be in place.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
As long as you are a full member delegate there should be no requirements
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
There should be none.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The delegates choose who should be their next chair, ultimately putting restrictions like a past ministerial term bottleneck the choices they have to this influential position.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The experience and if they are up to the job should be decided through campaigning, their manifesto, and debating.
James B. - Desert District: 
If you’re a delegate then the voters should decide if you’re accomplished enough.
Not formal boundaries.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark is no longer present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Noted
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Shall we move on?
R.M. Grainger - Scoria: 
Scoria is no longer present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
5 more of the discussions, then we get to the real meat and bones of the session.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
The what?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The main body.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I imply that the Speaker was making a metaphor, the meat and bones of the session refers to topics aside from electoral reform.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Onward: <strong>How should we vote? (i.e. Delegate or by nation)</strong>?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I personally think by delegate as the system of per-delegate vote is currently in effect for all other acts
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe a vote by delegate will encourage more activity amongst the current delegates
Yu-Xia is no longer present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I personally think by delegation as well.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted Mr Xia.
Any further comment? I believe some delegates were in favour of nation voting.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I think by delegate is more consistent. But nation voting is more fair.
Some nations with fewer delegates will have a lower vote weight.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I am personally fine either way.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Per-nation voting could lead to a Chair getting elected whilst losing the popular vote (though is unlikely)
If each nation gets 1 vote, a lot of nations that have 3 delegates will have the same as nations with 1 delegate
Soaring - Regelis: 
That is correct, but it could also lead to a nation with 3 delegates out voting a nation with a dingle delegate. The best solution would encourage member nations to add all available delegate positions.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Should the results of the vote be public?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I personally agree, but only the number of vote per candidate should be public, the personal information of who voted should not be public.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wholly concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
If we did per-nation voting though, I am on the line of the voting details of each nation should be public.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe an observer has queried about voting earlier in the session. Should observers be allowed to vote?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark is again present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Welcome back.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
As an observer I think not, observers aren’t held to the same standard of members, so shouldn’t be able to vote in elections.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Any final notes on any vote related topics?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I request the floor after all vote related topics have been finished.
James B. - Desert District: 
<div class="quote">I believe an observer has queried about voting earlier in the session. Should observers be allowed to vote?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted Mr Lycon.
How many debates should we have, and on that note... when?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
3 sounds reasonable
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
I have a suggestion regarding debates.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Weekly I guess, if we ever did 2 round voting I suppose 2 before the first round and 1 between rounds
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
Each debate should have one main topic.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I presume this applies only to official Cupertino debates.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Elaborate.
James B. - Desert District: 
I also request the honorable delegate from Pinelandia to elaborate.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If a non-Alliance entity wished to for whatever reason host a debate on their own grounds, would such be counted against the debate counter?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I don't think that should be allowed; at least allow CESE to supervise it.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
James B. - Desert District: 
I have a question and if there is no answer suggest a discussion.
Will the debates be by text or voice/video?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I was thinking of doing one video debate.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe the Chair will be best placed to answer this.
Alas, he has.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Most likely by text or voice though.
James B. - Desert District: 
I say have them all be voice chats.
In a Discord VC, and video is fully optional.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The problem with video chat, is that not all candidates present are comfortable showing their face.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur as well.
James B. - Desert District: 
That is why U said video should be fully optional.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
What if a delegate doesn't want to speak through their voice?
Should text to speech be conducted?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Good point.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is TTS reliable?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I would say that, the best alternative right now
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Or a voice changer?
James B. - Desert District: 
I doubt any delegate is uncomfortable with their voice being heard, correct me if I’m wrong.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
TTS would be a great alternative.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Anything further?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
None from Monmark.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I am aware that the past few sessions have been exhausting with all the discussion of electoral reform, I would like to sincerely thank all delegates for participating in the democratic process and I'll be reading all the topics discussed before submitting the final bill for any possible changes to the electoral process.
I yield the floor back to the Speaker.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I agree
I have been very exhausted with the recent sessions.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
But alas, topics of electoral reform should be finished this session.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
and <span class="mention">#informal-members-pub</span> be outlawed?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes, they are private for a reason. The main question is what should be the punishment of it?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<div class="quote">Yes, they are private for a reason. The main question is what should be the punishment of it?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
I think that the members private channels should be treated as a privilege and not a right as a delegate, and that continued sharing can lead to a demotion for ministerial positions and removal from these private channels.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe that is fair.
Does the delegation present have any comment?

LamentTwice: 
I believe it is needed.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Last couple sessions they have been a debate against brick and mortar positions and us having Discord as our main point of communication
After some observing and research I have come to the conclusion that an active delegate should really be the only requirement Discord-wise, and such I support this amendment.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Should said delegate be suspended for whatever reason, what contact methods are open to reach said brick-and-mortar nation?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Email or expulsion- it is their responsibility in the end of the day
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Email, fourms, letter.
James B. - Desert District: 
What is Section A Article 2?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I suppose
James B. - Desert District: 
I see.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we any final points of order?
James B. - Desert District: 
I don’t believe so.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I don't believe so.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I agree with the Act.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
What remains on the agenda?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
A few acts, and a few discussions regarding projects, and membership applications.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted Mr Chair.
James B. - Desert District: 
Is there a formal session attendance expectation?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I too would like to know this information.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">Is there a formal session attendance expectation?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Like how often a member state must be present.
James B. - Desert District: 
Correct, he beat me to it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I would just think enough to show that you are a member of the CA, as supposed of not attending any sessions and most of us do not know that you are a member of the CA
James B. - Desert District: 
I think that is too subjective.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Thank you Mr. Lycon.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There is no official requirement, it is moreso an unofficial expectation not put to paper.
James B. - Desert District: 
Perhaps 1 attendance a month and if not, then a vote on a demotion to retain, demote to observer, or expel.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Would you support this act, under said pretences?

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted. Does anyone have anything further for us?
If not, we can proceed to our next proposal of sorts.
Mr Koehler has propositioned to the Chair that he re-do the Cupertino Coat of Arms. What are your thoughts on this?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
<div class="quote">Mr Koehler has propositioned to the Chair that he re-do the Cupertino Coat of Arms. What are your thoughts on this?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I believe the current Coat of Arms is sufficient.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I shall abstain.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Go ahead, keep the toque.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
To my knowledge, there is no toque on the current coat of arms. I believe that headdress is in fact a 'beanie'?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Toque is the term of beanie in Canada
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Ah, I apologise.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry about being late, Humberlea is present.
James B. - Desert District: 
I think the current CoA is a way of preserving our less serious roots while remaining no less serious.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Elaborate
James B. - Desert District: 
Well it dates back to when we were less serious, keeping our culture.
If we kept say the 69 Hour Session, we’d become less serious.
The current CoA is a perfect goldilocks situation.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Sorry about my abscense, Aswington is present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
On the topic of said toque, I must note that the graphics of it have a different art style to the remainer of the arms... which does make it seem out of place.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted
James B. - Desert District: 
I think it fits the color scheme and looks nice. I’m no expert though.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Any final points of order?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
None from Monmark.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Nay.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We now have two..  discussions regarding the Lieutenant Chairmanship. I know a good few delegates have been pondering this.
<strong>Should the Prime Minister Act be amended to require the Lieutenant Chairman be elected?</strong>
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I agree
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do the other delegations have points of order?
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I agree the proposal.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
What does the Prime Minister Act entail?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The PM Act does not call for the position to be term limited
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I agree.

Anthony I - Saspearian: 
It seems reasonable
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
On the same note.. how should said position be elected?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I shall abstain, it seems beneficial, however, I don’t know if extending the bureaucracy is the best thing to do.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
l abstain honestly
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
The Lieutenant Chairman being elected Separately would mean more freedom.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Noted.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Have a good evening everyone.
James B. - Desert District: 
It must be elected.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
But the Lieutenant Chairman being elected with association to a Chairman candidate would mean less conflict.
James B. - Desert District: 
That’s true.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Does the Saspearian Delegation infer the running mate system?
Anthony I - Saspearian:

Yes indeed.

Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
It would be a somewhat good idea, although in my opinion it would be a bit exaggerated in a organization. The important thing would be for the members of the council to collaborate with each other.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I do not find the need honestly considering how small the alliance is
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Should we revive the CA Ministerial Insignia?
I believe our more senior cadre may remember these from the spring era.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
On April we made some seals for the then-pre-existing ministries. Some Ministers have been brining up making logos for their ministry as some agencies have them.

Welcome to micronationalism! You may have heard us from Sealand or Molossia, this community is full of micronations. The purpose of this guide is to start a micronation. This project started on 19 February 2020 and is largely a work in progress right now.</div>
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Ah, that's the one.
Are you interested in a revival of this?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
It could bring more awareness to the alliance and could have more micronations come into existence, so I'd see no reason not to.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur as well.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
A final note on these projects: what are your thoughts on the proposed GUM-CA recommendation system?
<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">The Cupertino Alliance is considering the possible acquisition of the Joining the GUM agency, considering it is inactive, and is also considering the adoption of a recommendation system for GUM applicants as a replacement to the agency. I, personally feel like that would be best for both parties. We are currently looking for opinions for this idea and if there is enough support I will propose it to both CA Parliament and GUM Quorum. I've talked with Cristi, Leon, and Zarel regarding the idea and they all support it.
I would like to note that Dhrubajyoti Roy and another GUM member have stated they are possibly reviving said program themselves in the GUM.
Ely: 
<div class="quote">does anyone have any opinions on this?

I have no objections.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted, though the GUM MDI / Help Joining the GUM is mainly ran by Zarel and Cristi
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Although I agree with the plan, Mr. Roy has been kicked from this Alliance, why should we get his help?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It was not a proposed collaboration, moreso an unforeseen occurance.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Perhaps coincidence would have been a better choice of terminology.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The polls have been quite strange
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Are you interested in a revival of this?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
In my experience so far, I have regretted where I have placed my support in the polls, as the candidates I have supported, haven't made the best choices in my eyes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Australis is present.
I support the polls thus far, they have allowed us to gain valuable data.

<div class="quote">In my experience so far, I have regretted where I have placed my support in the polls, as the candidates I have supported, haven't made the best choices in my eyes.
James B. - Desert District: 
The actual turnout of delegates is lower than it should be in my opinion.
Two votes makes a huge difference and it’s quite annoying.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I personally think that at such an early stage, we have had too many polls... though this is including outsourced polls not conducted by the CESE. Nominations aren't even open yet.
James B. - Desert District: 
I very much agree.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
What are the cons of having too many polls though?
James B. - Desert District: 
It makes people confused.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Voter fatigue.
James B. - Desert District: 
They think a candidate is surging, trailing when nominations aren’t yet open.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I worry it will skew later results with a drop in turnout.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Not saying plenty of polls are bad... but we have had 4 or 5 in a week.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright
Would 3 max a week (1 Google Forms, 1 Discord, and interchangeable for top two / three?)
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Maybe limit to one poll biweekly?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I honestly think that is too low
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Should a legal limit be imposed.. or would it be preferable for an informal guideline?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

I believe this was .. during a New Eiffelic election? I don't recall well I'm afraid.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville:

Without evidence to support this claim, we can't reject them based on that.
I maintain my support for their entrance.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Any thoughts regarding this bill
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I am in support of the amendments to this act.
Important to get these ironed out before the upcoming chairmanship election.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I support the reforms made to this act.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
sister.ray: 
Nordale is present
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted, any thoughts regarding bill present?
James B. - Desert District: 
I support.
I myself was initially hesitant at a bill that would stop Lieutenant Chairs from being elected.
However, I have changed my mind as I think that having the top two positions of the alliance be united is very important and crucial.
Ergo, I indeed support this motion.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
to their first session (I think?).
James B. - Desert District: 
It is indeed.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
Welcome Ms. Nordale!
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The process of single transferable vote will be used in this election. Two round was also decided but was scrapped since it will require more resources and time for another election.
James B. - Desert District: 
Understandable.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Any final thoughts for bill present?
sister.ray: 
Not from Nordale
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Not from Aswington.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright then, let's move on
Soaring - Regelis: 
Regelis is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The CESE will be releasing its full plan for this election later next week (following passage of bill aforementioned), but some parts of the plan will be discussed.
Any thoughts regarding these planned dates?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I was considering perhaps mid-January to be a more suitable time, for the transition of power to run smoothly.
For election day.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And so that everything is ironed out in time for the day
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The only alternate day is 22 - 24 January
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
So far I don't see any problem with the proposal. The date of the elections, I think it's good, to better organize the electoral event.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur with the honorable delegate from Aswington.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I concur.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
In addition, I do not think the 9th January for eligible voters rule should be in place. They may perhaps be a new delegate approved as a full member in mid january but because of this clause cannot vote. Is there a reason for this being in here?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The rule was made to avoid increased possibilities of candidates inviting new delegates in order to sway the results in favour to them.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm not sure on this one.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Explain to us a little about that.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's pretty simple, there may be new unaffiliated member states joining the Alliance and being accepted as full member not being able to vote, which would be a corruption of the democratic system. I doubt that any candidate could influence a member to join solely for this purpose in time.

James B. - Desert District: 
I support Bir Tawil, not Marie Byrd.
Ergo, I can’t support this.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'd like to concur with Jamez.
James B. - Desert District: 
I would support a stand-alone Bir Tawil.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville:

There are actually some great and professional Antarctic nations.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Do you know of any professional Bir Tawil nations?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Exactly.
James B. - Desert District: 
One has less claims. It’s that simple.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Well if there happened to be a Bir Tawil professional micronation, should we repeal the amendment..?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It depends on the nation and situation.
At this point I would be abstaining.
&#92429;lͥunͣaͫ &amp; &#120284; &#119812;&#119834;&#119853; ᴛᴜɴᴀ ❦: 
Both lands are macronationally unclaimed, empty deserts which no nation can get to
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I think that most of all we should not receive as members or observers the micronations that are claiming Bir Tawil, because they are quite a lot. About the other area in claim, I have no idea.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Antarctica should not be exempt just because of Westartica
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Perhaps more ideally a bill outlawing bogus/unrealistic claims adopted instead?
I can't remember what convention it's called.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I support that.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Edgbaston.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Would this clause suffice?
James B. - Desert District: 
Yes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes, but what constitutes unrealistic and unreachable land claims?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Just like the  considered to have the features that a micronation that is six (6) months or older has., it is ultimately for members to decide

I am in support of this act in this case.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
And changed to Or in this clause

Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
No for the moment.
Besides, I will remain neutral about the act.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I sincerely apologise for missing half an hour. I accidentally fell asleep.
Pinelandia present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
No problem.
Any discussion regarding act present?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I vehemently oppose it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Reasoning?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Whilst yes, these kinds of claims are considered bad practice, I see such an act as contrary to the spirit of micronationalism.
It would disqualify notable nations such as Ponderosa Hills.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Please elaborate.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Ponderosa Hills does not currently claim an Antarctic territory following repealment of the Antarctic Claims Act.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Nevertheless, several notable micronations have ceremonial claims in some of these regions, never intending to actually govern over them micronationally.
Or for a more familiar example, even Naveria.
Nations should be judged on a case-to-case basis. Not blanket banned over a patch of ice.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah, I was considering a case to case basis as well.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Please forgive my tardiness, Atiera is now present for this session.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Otherwise should clause F be changed to
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
How are we to determine what is unrealistic or unreachable?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Like the six month clause, members do
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Sorry for the interruption, is this about the Bir Tawil Bill?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Soaring - Regelis: 
It would be a case by case basis I assume.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
So essentially we are passing an act for the sake of it, based on something the delegates have up to now managed perfectly fine as per protocol?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Noted, thank you.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This basically formally adds it into the criteria and allows the Commissioner who is writing the remarks to report on it (in the last table) for review by members
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
And what is the commissioner expected to do? Ask people where they live, and pull out a compass?
I apologise if this may appear to be confrontational. It is not intended as such.
Soaring - Regelis: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Category:List_of_Micronations_Claiming_Bir_Tawil">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Category:List_of_Micronations_Claiming_Bir_Tawil</a>

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Not sure what are you saying with compasses and such; if a bill is present and active regarding a concernable land claim, the Commissioner will simply add a No to the table with the row regarding the land claims.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Let's move on from solely Bir Tawil and Marie Byrd Land. What other landmasses would raise red flags.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
All of Toronto
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Massive claims.
Massive claims without proof of ownership
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Soaring - Regelis: 
An island under the ocean, entire city, a body of the solar system (like Jupiter), land on mars or the moon, (an eighth of Australia *cough*).
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Promatia....
Arkovia.....
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That made me laugh, Promatia moment
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Chair. Upon the conclusion of this acts discussion, I have a point of order regarding a potential error on the previous bill.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You have the floor.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Bill States the following:
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That is correct, thank you
Any final discussion regarding motion regarding land claims before we move on?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from me.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
No for the moment.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright then, let's move on
James B. - Desert District: 
Erm...
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
During the month of December or January or February, should the Cupertino Alliance create an news cooperative between member nations and news networks in these member nations can join? The purpose of this affiliation is to ensure a standard of quality and fact-checking is maintained, otherwise news organizations can be removed from this alliance. Benefits include creditability, as well as we plan to move the Nutmeg service for use for only members within this organization. Any thoughts regarding this plan?
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Sounds a good idea for emergent media.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Apologies if I have misunderstood.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Sounds cool.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">Is this a proposal to form a proofreading agency?
James B. - Desert District: 
I would support this but there needs to be some way to prevent bias.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Essentially, a list of accredited publications, &#225; la MicroWiki?
James B. - Desert District: 
Because what if a Chair allows one that is positive towards them but won’t to one that is neutral.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I suppose it can have its own meeting room where news organization can appoint a few delegates and those delegates can vote to remove members.
<div class="quote">Essentially, a list of accredited publications, &#225; la MicroWiki?
James B. - Desert District: 
Instead of making a whole division why not just combine it with the Nutmeg Project?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
A division isn't planned, more likely an agency.
James B. - Desert District: 
Close enough, my question stands.
Why not just merge with the Nutmeg Project?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe if it were to go ahead, it would be preferable to incorporate it under the wing of the Nutmeg Project to consolidate our projects.
James B. - Desert District: 
I wholeheartedly agree.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
By merging do you mean under the Nutmeg Discord server?
James B. - Desert District: 
Under the Nutmeg Project.
The whole system.
Just combine it with the place that already specializes in journalism.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That is planned.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It can be run on the Nutmeg Server, all the journalism sorted in one location makes things easier.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Is there any final discussion for this proposed idea and if this idea gets implemented would any news organizations be interested in participating in it?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am interested in applying the Brookside Gazette onto the program. I can also see about attracting MicroWeekly to such as well.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Superb.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Given the possible/unclear merger of the latter, you might have the Home Made Crown Journal as a bonus... if I am charismatic enough.
James B. - Desert District: 
I have considered making a micronational general publication but my tech dealings just aren’t good enough. I would be interested in joining an already made micronational publication but that isn’t especially relevant to this session.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Otherwise, let's move on.
Relating to press, the Cupertino Nacre may also get revived with the help of Daniel Roscoe. We will likely be doing news focused on Alliance interior with also some news related to member nations without a news source.
Nacre was previously the alliance's news organization before being defunct due to lack of resources, not being the priority at the time, nor time.
Considering the increased manpower of this alliance I feel it is a good time to revive it.
Is there any discussion regarding this plan?
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Sounds a interesing idea.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am fully in support of this.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur

Will the 2nd Chairmanship Election Amendment be put forward by the Urgent Proposals Act, to settle uncertainties about the upcoming elecfion?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I have a proposal.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You have the floor.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
We would like to propose to the members, that the CESE participate as an observer in the general elections to be held not only in our country, but also in other elections of the countries that make up the CA, to monitor the electoral process and ensure voter confidence in the citizens.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
An application was received dated 24 August 2020 for an election planned on the 12 of December.
The CESE will be messaging you regarding this election later this week.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The CESE can, and has on several occasions conducted electoral observance in several members states.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes.

Okay. It is very important.

Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
None from me.
James B. - Desert District:

There have been a couple seats open,
If interested feel free to state here or DM me.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Well... If no one is going to speak up then I will.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I would be willing to become the superior judge.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Point of Order.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You have the floor.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is the office of Superior Judge not occupied by Mr Smith?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
He is leaving from the whole micronational community December if I recall.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I might be able to run for Superior Judge
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Has Mr Smith announced his resignation from the position?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I am going to be dropping out of the race for chair of the Cupertino Alliance and instead applying for one of said positions. Hence, I will be putting all my trust in my openent himself, Daniel Roscoe, he is the most competent, besides myself (that's just personal bias though.) Thank you, I yield back to the honorable chair.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
He did plan a statement of his resignation.
He did state that we was originally going to plan to resign the 17 November.
He is most likely going to resign on 1 December.
James B. - Desert District: 
I would consider running for Superior Judge.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted. 
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
So, all the positions he held in other micronations, including in this organization, become vacant in December 1?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I am unaware of the details.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I would also consider running for superior judge.
James B. - Desert District: 
So that confirms you intend to drop out the Chair race?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I plan to run for lieutenant chair, as long as this position is available to run for.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The position officially is not up for election.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Did you not see my statement? Are you not paying attention, sir?
James B. - Desert District: 
Excuse me?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I think this is what Mr. Munroe was referring to.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Correct.
Thank you, Mr. Xia.
James B. - Desert District: 
I didn’t see that message.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe it would be preferable if we get proper confirmation from the incumbent judge, as this information seems very ambiguous to me.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted, elaborate on the latter.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I do not believe there should be requirements, as with the Chair there shouldn't be any restrictions on who should run, except for being a delegate.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That is foolish.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Would you say the same for the Chair position?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
For superior judge, I absolutely believe that there should be requirements.
James B. - Desert District: 
Which should be?
The delegates should choose the requirements themselves and vote accordingly, no official guidelines are necessary.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Order.
I do agree that there should be some requirements to the process of the selection of the Superior Judge; most likely through an application where scenarios are presented and applicants will be required to answer them.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Election or not, the Superior Judge reviews information, some of which can be incredibly sensitive, personal or scathing.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
if you so wish?
Due to the fact I think we should keep this session moving and discuss this another time.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted- the position of Minister of Tech can be decided in this bloc of sessions, though I do prefer adding an Superior Judge test in which those answers will be reviewed by Parliament.
Is there any final discussion regarding that ministerialship before we move on?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from I.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Humberlea is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted, I really do not prefer having me hold office as a major conflict of interest.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I must concur with Mr Lycon
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If it is necessary, I would not mind an emergency session with the urgent proposals act being invoked.
I rest the floor.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Is there any discussion regarding the future of the Superior Judge position?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Would you mind if I drafted an informal set of requirements for the position and send you them privately? This will also include the test I would think should be necessary for the position.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Sure.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Noted, you will receive this shortly then.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright.

I do not see the point with the abstain option to be frank, we'll already know who would win the election.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I support the changes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What would be the purpose of such, other than to delay the inevitable?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
To see the approval of the only standing candidate, I suppose.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Although, I think it should be in the form of a plebiscite, where the members can vote Yes or No.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That would lead to further complications. What happens when the sole candidate receives a majority no.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You have a point there.

Any discussion regarding this observer?

I'd be in favour of Monmark's upgrade.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am in support of the upgrade in membership of this observer state.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I concur with Mr. Valentinus.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I support the upgrade of Monmark into a full member state.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Any final discussion regarding Monmark?

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I haven't seen Moletopia around much
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
There is little information on them for two categories.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Note that the remarks were made when they were voted in
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to abstain from comment. I have been unable to form an opinion regarding this membership.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I abstain about upgrading Moletopia as a member.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with Mr. Valentinus.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted.

None from Australis.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
None from Aswington.

Any discussion regarding this member?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I haven't seem them in sessions except a brief appearance, without decorum, in the last Asian/Oceanian session.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
They have barely contributed to the alliance's functions.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm leaning on keep as observer.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
There is little information on a few thing and foreign relations seem to be small.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I concur too.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe it would be preferable to allow them to remain an observer, lest we find reason to rescind such.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Any final discussion regarding Huai Shao?
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
No for the moment.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville:

Any discussion regarding this applicant?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
There is little information on many things.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As I have stated in sessions previous, I would support the implementation of observer status. I have had positive experiences with their delegate, and believe they may be alliance material.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't have enough information on this nation so I will be voting against it.
I think how nice or rude the delegate is isn't very relevant to if the nation is CA material.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I mean professionalism is a large aspect of this alliance.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I refrain from commenting about Maple.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Professionalism of the nation... not really the delegate.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Their nation has largely been involved in the League of Independent Nations until late, alongside fellow Alliance nation Atiera.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I can say from experience in the LIN that the Maple Republic is a capable and professional nation, I would support their entry into the alliance.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I assure you, as a citizen of Maple, when it comes to business, we are very serious and professional.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'm sorry I don't know what the League of Independent Nations is it sounds like a YAMO.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Maple Autonomous Region is more than capable of being a member of the , Cupertino Alliance.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Check <span class="mention">#informal</span>
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean the LIN shouldn't really affect anything considering Atiera is CA material
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Point of order, that is irrelevant.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The League of Independent Nations is large intermicronational organisation, notable within the Reddit Sector, though the two are by no means mutually inclusive.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Haven't seen Maple around in Reddit.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
At risk of veering off topic, they have been absent from the platform a while.. for several reasons I believe many are fully aware.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
We withdrew from the LIN due to professionalism, Maple, Monmark, Atiera.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We are veering off topic here.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Let's move back to the MAR
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Maple is Alliance material and Sylvie is an excellent person with great ideas.
My opinion.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I don’t know much about them.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
There MicroWiki page is basically just a infobox and the remarks tell me close to nothing so I can not make a well informed decison.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Yes, they are not active on microwiki at all.
I can answer any questions in the meantime
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Is there any final discussion regarding Maple before we move on?
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
No for the moment.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Not from me.
James B. - Desert District: 
Apologies for my leave of absence.
I’ve returned.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Who's to say they won't go inactive again and be expelled again?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
How can I trust they will be active again?
James B. - Desert District: 
We can’t.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
James B. - Desert District: 
Therefore I won’t support.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
How long will Caddia remain this time.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I will oppose them.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I stand with Mr. Burdette at this time.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Honestly? I believe they need more time.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Is there any final discussion regarding Caddia?
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Nothing.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Not from me.

The MicroWiki Page has incorrect formatting.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They also have many mistakes including the fact that there date formats don't follow the manual of style.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Not that bad. I could fix it.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Are we debating wiki syntax, or the observership status of an applicant?
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur with Mr. Valentius.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We have an entire ministry dedicated to assisting in said front.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let us stay on topic.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
They don't fulfill the 6 month clause so I'm not in favour
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I would vote against their application for observership.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'm opposing this nation for Observer status.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Not in favour.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I am not in favour of this nation for observer status.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Any final discussion regarding Mexno?
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
No for the moment.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Mr. Chair, how many more applications are left?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Any discussion regarding this applicant?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Way too new.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Their constitution is bad.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It was literally founded 11 days ago.
James B. - Desert District: 
Their Constitution has typos.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They are not 6 months old so I oppose this nation for observer.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
yet again, are we judging an applicant by grammatical skill?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
There’s hardly any information about them.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It does not fulfill the 6 month clause so I'll oppose.
James B. - Desert District: 
If you can’t put in the dedication to not have typos in your main document how can you be dedicated to the alliance?
It doesn’t come close to getting to the 6 month characteristics.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
On a important document like their constitution I think it would be foolish to ignore as it is a sign of unprofessionalism.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The only information on them is a few national holidays.
James B. - Desert District: 
I strongly oppose.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Not going to even get started on the holidays.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Avengers Endgame Remembrance Day is my favourite holiday.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Yeah, they definitely need more development.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Celebrate Avengers Endgame Remembrance Day on the 26th instead of ANZAC day
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Let's move back to the topic.
Any final discussion regarding Francisnia?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
None
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
None from Australis.

They seem to be well established.
James B. - Desert District: 
Mr. Chair may I after membership applications have the floor?

They will be ratifying their documents in a later date so we can't admit them officially to the alliance before then

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes.
James B. - Desert District: 
Noted.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am supportive of their observership. By the time of the third reading, they must have ratified the required documentation. If the Minister of Membership Attainment insures they are duly notified, then we shall be sailing a smooth ship.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">We cannot ratify your charter until we understand the fate of our application</div>
It is to note that their Prime Minister was the former Vice President of Aenderia for a few days, if that is significant
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That makes sense tbh

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is it not contrary to our rules regarding the application process?

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from I.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I can support Lundenwic only in observership.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Should the application be amended so that ratification of these documents is a requirement when you enter for observership as opposed to before?
I mean if we do the present rule, if we reject, the Charter is de jure still law there until they repeal it

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This will complicate the application process.
I believe a preferable alternative would be an amended clause noting that the documents come into force upon the grant of observership / membership into the alliance.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Possibly.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Well, I support doing that. Many micronations that apply for membership in the organization do not have some of the documents. However, as the delegate from Pinelandia says, we would run the risk of complicating membership registration.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Mr. Valentinus.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I approve of this amendment.

I suppose.
You have the floor.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Thank you.
I'd like to propose an alteration to the criteria for being awarded the Cupertino Service Ribbon.
Many delegates shall perhaps spend their whole time here, contributing massively, but not leaving the Alliance, thus rendering them unable to receive this award.
I propose that the criteria be instead altered to a minimum of six months of service within the Alliance, with considerable achievement.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Is there any discussion regarding this idea?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I present a point of order?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I agree that it is silly you have to retire in order to be eligible.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have a relatively minor query regarding the alliance's affairs.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It would most likely be combined with the Q4 report.
Planned December 2020.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I see.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted, the problem is that we are already near the release date of Q4, there would be no use to release a Q3 report if we are in like a month away from the planned Q4 report release date.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Session starting soon.
LamentTwice: 
Nova Troms&#248; is present
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Pinelandia Present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I would like to state before this session that my internet is being rather slow tonight, so I may be a bit slow in responding.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Thank you all for attending the 46th session of the Cupertino Alliance. We shall now get started.
Before that though, this session falls upon the same day as Mr. Lycon's birthday, so make sure you wish him a happy birthday.
First up on the agenda for tonight: <strong>CESE plan relating to debate and election time and date</strong>
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" style="color: rgb(94, 197, 171); background-color: rgba(94, 197, 171, 0.1);">@Members</span>, do we have any discussion on this?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What is the plan?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark is intermittently present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm personally not sure, the agenda just says that. It's set as a discussion.
<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">The CESE has decided that 29 January 2021 at 12AM EST (5AM UTC) to 31 January 2021 at 11:59PM EST (4:59AM UTC at 1 February 2021) would be the best for the election.
I believe it's this?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Should this be said plan, I personally am fine with such.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur. I did however express my concern in the last session at how late the election is to take place.
fvck: 
Maple is also intermittently present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This gives a very short time for transition and the appointment/election of a new Cabinet.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What would you propose as an alternative?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
When initially thinking about the election, I imagined it'd be around 14 January. Just seems like a good date to me.
And it gives one month for a transition of server ownerships, account information, nominations and elections for a new cabinet, etc
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is a whole month necessary?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I just don't see how logistically possible it'd be to form a new cabinet, unless it was appointed rather than elected, as is the case in many macronations.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Is that all the discussion on this topic?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Nothing further from I.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present but will only be popping in and out.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, we'll move on.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe the Marie Byrd and Lundenwic Amendments are to different documents entirely, no?

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Sorry, it showed up when I typed it in in search.
Any comments on this amendment?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am personally opposed to it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
It restricts nations which, while incredibly serious, have claims in these regions.
Take Naveria for example. They intend on applying soon, but I believe they have an Antarctic claim.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Ponderosa Hills until very recently also possessed claims in such regions.
I believe delegates should be trusted to make such judgements in their own.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Humberlea is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I support the article seeing as claiming Antarctica brings up questions about how enforcable the claim is and subsequently the nation's pwoers as a state.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe that this should only apply if the nation has a completely unreasonable claim down there, such as claiming all of Marie Byrd Land
fvck: 
I support the article for the same reason as Mr.Ross, I feel there is not logistical merit behind a claim you cannot visit yourself
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I quite like this amendment.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
How enforceable is a macronation's claim on Antarctica though?
There are nations thousands of kilometers away with no ability to actually exercise control over these vast areas.
fvck: 
Macronations technically aren't able to claim Antarctic land either
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Several delegates here hold office in micronations far from where they can visit reasonably. How would logistical merit be determined?
fvck: 
How does said land contribute in said micronation
If you are unable to even set foot in such a claim, I don't see it's worth
Of course some may be able to set foot in Antarctic land, however a majority can't
However I also don't think a small insignificant claim should bar an applicant from acceptance
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Antarctic_Micronational_Union">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Antarctic_Micronational_Union</a>
Antarctic Micronational Union</div>
The Antarctic Micronational Union (AMU) is the first micronational multinational organisation that comprises only of Antarctic micronations.</div>
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
How is exercising power in micronationalism possible? It's an oxymoron.
LamentTwice: 
I am sorry for leaving the session abruptly.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You can't sufficiently exercise sovereignty, Antarctica or not
fvck: 
If you have access and rights to your claim, you may do anything within your macronations law
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As such, I do not see any reason as to why this act should be passed.
LamentTwice: 
Could a delegate brief me on what is being discussed?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Scroll up.
LamentTwice: 
I am quite busy.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Bill outlawing Antarctic/Outlandish claims
fvck: 
I do believe extracelestrial claims are completely out of the question
LamentTwice: 
I believe as long as it isn’t absurdly large and or silly, it shouldn’t be in effect.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think that this should not be a set in stone rule but one that is chosen by the delegates.
fvck: 
Antarctic claims are different as they are on the planet
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Much like the 6 month rule.
LamentTwice: 
People can claim, but not overly claim land
fvck: 
I concur with the delegate from Australis
It should more so be at the application reviewers discretion
LamentTwice: 
Especially since new Reddit nations have emerged that have claimed French Polynesia for instance.
I think it shouldn’t apply as much in regards to Antarctica, but more so anywhere else.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't see why it can't be a rule, not claiming stuff that you can't access is a reasonable expectation.
LamentTwice: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Burdette, can you access Humberlea?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I do concur, however it should be handled on a case by case basis.
fvck: 
Because, if say a micronation is very legitimate and a worthy addition to Cupertino, however they claim a kilometre in Antarctica, it would be of obligation to turn them away
LamentTwice: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
A notable example of course being the esteemed Commonwealth of Naveria.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Nicholas Lokin can, I am a global citizen many macronations have citizens that don't live in there claims.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Is there any more on this matter?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from I.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
None from me
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
None from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
fvck: 
None from myself
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Onto our next topic: <strong>Cupertino Alliance news cooperative</strong>
<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">During the month of December or January or February, should the Cupertino Alliance create an news cooperative between member nations and news networks in these member nations can join? The purpose of this affiliation is to ensure a standard of quality and fact-checking is maintained, otherwise news organizations can be removed from this alliance. Benefits include creditability, as well as we plan to move the Nutmeg service for use for only members within this organization. Any thoughts regarding this plan?</div>
fvck: 
I like this plan so long as it doesn't provide unfair competition for Micronational news sources
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I love this plan for the same reasons as Ms. Sylvie.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Should this prove to be some form of accreditation, I shalt approve. Will this be incorporated under the Nutmeg Program?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm unsure, but I believe the news programs need a lot of unification.
Nutmeg/Nacre/CAPA merger.
LamentTwice: 
I believe it should be under the Nutmeg project.
fvck: 
I agree with Mr. Roscoe
A unified body would provide less confusion
LamentTwice: 
Can I bring another topic up after this one?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Not until all topics, and membership, have been discussed.
LamentTwice: 
Alright.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any other discussion on this matter?
fvck: 
None from myself
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
None from Monmark.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next topic: <strong>Future position openings for vacancies</strong>
LamentTwice: 
Is there a list of vacant positions?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Does this refer to current vacant positions? This is all that's on the agenda for this topic.
LamentTwice: 
Yes it does.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
But yes, they're here
LamentTwice: 
I think we may need to begin recruiting reliable people for these positions
If I recall correctly, Zarel is the Superior Judge
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As I have made duly clear, strict vetting <strong>must</strong> be in place for the Superior Judge.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If, for whatever reason, something happens to my Chairmanship campaign, I would likely run for Superior Judge.
LamentTwice: 
I am sure we do not want a Superior Judge who is biased.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Not just that, they need to be someone people can trust to have potentially sensitive information shared to.
LamentTwice: 
I concur.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I personally feel I could be good for it, however, I would wish for more experience before applying myself, have been in this alliance for less than a month after all.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Is there anything else delegates have to say on this topic?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
None from Monmark.
fvck: 
None from Maple
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright then, we'll move on.
<strong>Amends to the Cupertino Alliance Service Ribbon</strong>
LamentTwice: 
I agree with this motion.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I see no problem with this.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wholly concur with this amendment.
LamentTwice: 
In my honest opinion, it should have been like this when it was first created.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur, which is why I proposed said amendment.
fvck: 
I agree with the motion
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Anything else on this matter?
LamentTwice: 
None from me.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
None from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Time to move on to Membership Applications, then.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Do they have a MW page?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Doesn't seem so.
LamentTwice: 
They claim to have one.
I’ll go and look for it.
They do.
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Individualist_Republic_of_Mexno">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Individualist_Republic_of_Mexno</a>
Individualist Republic of Mexno</div>
Established November, 7th 2020</div>
it’s not of perfect quality from a first look.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They seem very young and their page is a bit of a mess imo.
LamentTwice: 
I am willing to fix it for them.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I could do it but I'd need to contact the leader for information.
fvck: 
I am not definite on this, but if they do favour one religion over others it can be argued that a human right is being broken.
I need to stress I am not definite on this but if it is so, then I wouldnt accept that
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark is de jure secular, but we do have a habit of favoring our state church, that no one is required to join.
LamentTwice: 
If the religion isn’t threatening another individual’s rights then possibly not.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
fvck: 
Freedom of religion in this case, my home province does this
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's formed on 7 November and underdeveloped, as such it's not suitable in my opinion.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It doesn't seem like they're limiting the ability for other religions.
fvck: 
That is why I said I'm not definite on that
LamentTwice: 
I concur.
fvck: 
Just pointed out the possibility I saw
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Now that's a better reason to deny them, so I concur.
fvck: 
I don't think enough information is given
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I also concur.
fvck: 
Hence why I wasn't able to really know for sure if any religious favoritism is happening
Thus I concur
LamentTwice: 
I shall abstain on this one.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I shall be against this one.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I will likely be voting against.
LamentTwice: 
I would like to contact them in regards to their MicroWiki page.
fvck: 
I would vote against
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I will be voting against.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright.
Shall we move along?
fvck: 
Yes
LamentTwice: 
Yes.

Ah yes, the nation that celebrates Avengers Endgame Remembrance Day
LamentTwice: 
Their page is very small.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm not even joking.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I shall vote against, their predecessor was a simulationist Republic of the Spratly Islands.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
fvck: 
Yes I will be voting against
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This was founded even more recently than Mexno.
LamentTwice: 
They seem to be involved with the Reddit sector.
fvck: 
I don't believe they are fit for professionalism
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They're very young as well.
LamentTwice: 
I don’t deem them fit either.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As I just mentioned.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">They seem to be involved with the Reddit sector.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
They are, that's not exactly reason for denial, but there are more reasons right here.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I see no reason to reject someone based on where there nation is active on.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark used to be reddit sector, more civil than most there, still left.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
However I shall be voting against due to the underdeveloped nation and age of the nation.
LamentTwice: 
I’m not denying them solely on that fact. The Reddit sector is notoriously unprofessional and childish in nature.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
True but a fair amount of nations on Reddit are fairly 'barbaric' in a sense.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I apologise for my absence, I was fetching some items for a curry.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
LamentTwice: 
No worries.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Where are we up to right now?
fvck: 
I will be voting against because I don't believe in its current form they have the capacity for true professionalism
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I shall be voting against them for the same reasons as well as general unprofessionalism.
LamentTwice: 
I will be voting against them.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Regarding Francisnia, they are only around 10-20 days old, and have very little information. In the GUM, they would likely be executively rejected.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah.
I believe such a system should be implemented.
However, that's off topic.
Any more discussion on the application for Francisnia?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that we should adopt the ability to executively reject some nations but that's a different story as you've said.
Also none from me.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
None from me.

And well known, too.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I've seen them in the GUM before.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I would advocate for the acceptance of Lundenwic into the Cupertino Alliance.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Until the Lundenwic Amendment passes, I am against this nation applying.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I see no real reason to reject.
LamentTwice: 
This one seems promising.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I agree.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Until that's happened, then.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As shown within the remarks, the applicant has not ratified the mission or the charter, which as of now is a requirement.
LamentTwice: 
I am voting to accept.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe it was passed, already.
fvck: 
I will abstain
LamentTwice: 
I shall return to the session soon.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I shall abstain until there is confirmation on this.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Whether it has passed or not they remain unratified. The amendment simply states the legislation is not in force until they are confirmed as a member.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville:

Well they have Definitely gotten enough information
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Intriguing.

They seem professional.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They don't appear too bad but they're only 1 month old.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Looking for something to reject it on, and honestly can't find anything.
Except for age.
But they're well developed for their age.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The age requirement was abolished many months ago.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They also appear to be run by Logan Jack whom I presume is the guy behind the 'this ain't no cyber war, Logan' meme which is interesting.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
6 months or features of 6 months still exists.
fvck: 
If I remember correctly I believe it's 6 months of development
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Sylvie is correct.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Even if the age thing has been abolished or not, we should still look at admitting nations of a decent age.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That would be Daniel Maloney you are thinking of.... a rather disreputable figure.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Australis was four months old upon its acceptance into the Alliance.
fvck: 
I believe it would be unfair to turn a nation away that is clearly very developed
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think he's referring to the 'Logan' Maloney refers to. Alas, that's off topic.
I would like to vote in favour of this nation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

I will vote in favour aswell

Immediate no.
For both reasons.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.

I vote against for these reasons and for not being independent.

I don’t understand why they are an Austenasian Crown Dependency.

Contact them directly to find out, I guess.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Absolutely not.
Paris Wright has been involved in server raiding on a micronational server recently.
Reportedly.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They have a very short page as well.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I shall be against for now.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will be voting no. They are too new and do not have a features of a 6 month old nation.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As will I.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I was informed by the Wendatian Leadership that Paris Wright amongst others conducted a raid on the Avienta Convention server.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Sad.
Is that all then?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I have no more to say on the matter.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
No further comment from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, then.
, you have the floor to discuss your proposal.
I'll give you until 12PM EST (5PM GMT) to respond, otherwise this session is adjourned at the mentioned time.
If any other delegates have something to present, please present it now.
LamentTwice: 
my apologies
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You still have time.
LamentTwice: 
I believe we need to make a choice regarding the macronational TV formats. PAL or NTSC.
NTSC has its advantages, but I believe the alliance should choose which one to use.
I am aware the majority uses the NTSC format
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Shouldn't this be based on whichever macronation you are located in?
LamentTwice: 
I’m more saying we need one for the alliance in general to support and or use
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
May I ask why this is necessary at this point in time? I have an opinion on the matter either way, but I’d like to know why you believe the alliance should choose.
LamentTwice: 
Because it’s usually a conflicting matter from what I’ve seen.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Well, considering that TV format is entirely based on location, I have to agree with the delegate from Australis. This should be up to individual nations based on their location.
SuperGuy1119: 
Georgienstine is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If I may ask what this is about?
I don't believe I was present when this was being discussed.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
No worries. The matter of choosing a television broadcasting format was brought up, and we’re currently debating on why the alliance should choose one.
Sebolivier: 
Georgienstine is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Ah right that makes sense.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Unfortunate time to show up, this is the very last topic.
If there is no more discussion, this session will be adjourned at 12:15PM EST (5:15PM GMT).

Maple is now present again
i have nothing to say on this topic

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
No biggie.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Alas, let us proceed.
The first matter on the agenda is the slated CESE plan in regards to the upcoming chairman elections.
What are your thoughts on this here proposal?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Also Re. elegible voters, is this for the nation as a whole or each individual delegate?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Monmark is present. 
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I've mentioned my opinion on this topic a few times, I think the election should be held earlier.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The voting diet is comprised of individual delegates, not nations.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
I assume that part that says 9 January 2020 is meant to  be 2021? or am I reading it wrong?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I presume that is the case.
It should be 2021.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted, I shall ensure the author is made aware of this.
Do we have any further comment on this plan?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
None from Australis.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
The spread of debates looks good. Other than that, no comment to make.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Splendid. Let us proceed to our next item: the Bir Tawil-Marie Byrd Amendment.
Bir Tawil - Marie Byrd Amendment</div>
Cupertino Alliance Bir Tawil - Marie Byrd Amendment Statues of the Cupertino Alliance, 2020 Published by Authority           Bir Tawil - Marie Byrd Amendment			19 November 2020     Copyright Statement The Cupertino Alliance Printer holds copyright on behalf of the Government of the Cupertin...</div>
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I've expressed my opposal to this act.
It should be handled on a case by case basis, rather than a blanket ban.
It limits many well known nations from joining.
Such as Naveria, Hrafnarfjall etc
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I personally support the amendment. Such claims are usually outlandish and made by non-serious nations who have heard about Molossia or Sealand once.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I can't see Hrafnarfjall ever applying to be fair.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It was an example.
Hencewhy I stated such as
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I know.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Well then, is that not off topic?
Lets stay on track.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Antarctic_Micronational_Union">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Antarctic_Micronational_Union</a>
Marka Mejakhansk: 
If i might give a comment on it. I think if micronational organisations need to be careful in deciding what does or does not count as a legitimate claim. Once the line is set, it can often move. Claiming these lands might seem ridiculous,  but its no more so than claiming some other more accessible places.
I see the point about nations who might have seen Sealand once and thus go for the obvious claims, but all things have to begin somewhere. Flandrensis has made a huge micronational mark by claiming Antarctic land, for example. If we exclude these claims because they may seem odd, we may be excluding the next great micronation without knowing it.
That's all, thank you for the floor.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any further discussion on the amendment?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Then I see fit to proceed to the topic of the proposed News Cooperative.
<div class="quote">During the month of December or January or February, should the Cupertino Alliance create an news cooperative between member nations and news networks in these member nations can join? The purpose of this affiliation is to ensure a standard of quality and fact-checking is maintained, otherwise news organizations can be removed from this alliance. Benefits include creditability, as well as we plan to move the Nutmeg service for use for only members within this organization. Any thoughts regarding this plan?</div>
Marka Mejakhansk: 
Sounds like a great idea, well worth pursuing
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with the honourable delegate from Nemkhavia.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I see no outstanding problem with this proposal either. I concur with the two above delegates.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Anything further?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
None from Australis.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
Nothing here
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Then let us proceed to the next discussion, revolving around several vacancies.
<div class="quote">Minister, Public Affairs
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The position for Superior Judge should, in my opinion, only be reserved for the most experienced delegates here.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
This may be relevant, and I have not yet expressed this to the Chair, but I am interested in persuing the position of Minister of Technology.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Do we have any thing else on the matter?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
None from the Unified Royal States of Australis, Mr. Valentinus, Minister of European and African Affairs.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Let us proceed to our final topic prior to membership applications.
The amendments to the Cupertino Service Ribbon.
<div class="quote">Amends to the Cupertino Alliance Service Ribbon
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As the person who authored this, I am heavily in favour of these amendments.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am also in favor of these amendments. Dedicating a majority of your micronational career to the Alliance is most definitely honorable, members should be allowed to receive the ribbon.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Humberlea is present
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Ah, just in time.
what are your thoughts on this proposal?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'm beginning to agree with Mr. Roscoe on this one it should be handled case by case.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Are you sure you're on the right topic there?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Sorry, I thought we were on the Bir Tawil amendment.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
All good.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
I think six months plus considerable achievement is a good set of criteria.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I agree with the amendments to make the Cupertino Alliances Service Ribbon easier to obtain.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Anything further before we move on?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'd be inclined to agree with the delegate from Nemkhavia.
None from Australis.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
None from me.

Alas, we are now moving on to membership applications.

Wow, I haven't seen Wegmat present in a long time.
Welcome.

I am firmly against Lundenwic joining as they have failed to ratify any of the required documents, such as the charter and mission.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Tesforia is more or less present.
I will not be very active this session.

It is only 9 in the morning so I’m not doing anything right now.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will be voting no here. They very much can ratify the charter, and they stated that they want to join to “be put through the application process.” They don’t appear to want to offer anything to the Alliance.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I concur.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
Ludenwic is a very developed nation.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The Lundenwic Amendment allows this nation to adopt the acts upon being accepted.
I support their application, so long as they do this.
It is understandable to not want to ratify something that you may not end up requiring, due to a rejected vote.

I would like to propose a an amendment to our membership policy. I'd like to enact a policy executively rejecting all nations younger than 1 month (30 days) old that attempt to apply. This would eliminate the sheer amount of membership applications received and reduce the amount of organizations joining and going inactive a few days later, as well as shortening session times.
William Cooper - Galte: 
I’d support this.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would also support this.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would most definitely support this.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would be in favour of such,
Marka Mejakhansk: 
I think that would be a good idea, give the nations involved a proper amount of time to get established
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I apologise for not being able to produce a piece of official legislature for this.
I also have another item to discuss after this.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The floor is yours.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
With a Chairmanship election on the horizon, it is evident that both candidates that have high chances of winning are not situated in the main  region, the Americas. As such, I propose that, following each Chairmanship election, the Region of the new Chair becomes the main region, with that regions ministry being abolished. The region that previously was the main region would have a ministry established.
This would facilitate the new Chairman being better suited to hosting main sessions.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe Mr Chairman has briefly mused over such an idea in months gone past.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Briefly being the keyword.
I am putting this forth to become official.
Either that, or all three ministries permanently exist, with the main region moving from term to term.
William Cooper - Galte: 
I would vote against this, I concede I’m not intimately familiar with the server demographics, however, the chair whomever it may fall upon, does not change them. It sounds to me as if the majority of members are in the Americas, and that wouldn’t change dependent on who happens to be chairperson.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Main sessions are intended to be hosted by the Chairman.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe the latter proposal from the honorable delegate from Australis would make the most sense, and be easiest to implement.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And with all due respect, how is a Chair in Asia/Oceania able to host an American time based session?
William Cooper - Galte: 
They shouldn’t.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Hence why a ministry for the Americas will be necessary.
friendly ghost: 
I am now present on behalf of Australis. Sorry for being late, I was not awake.
William Cooper - Galte: 
I simply don’t see the point of shifting the main region. The chair is meant to represent the electorate, no?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The main region is primarily intended to allow the Chair to host sessions.
At the very least, this act would create the an American Ministry.
To fulfil the vacancy without an American Chairman.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
I think the idea of the main region moving through the minsitries is probably best, we dont want to create any more logistical issues than there needs to be.
William Cooper - Galte: 
I don’t agree with that premise, that the chair must host the main session.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Why would you not agree with it?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's how it's worked for the past many months.
William Cooper - Galte: 
For these very logistical issues.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Good day, Aenderia is present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Welcome, Mr. Chair.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If an act were to be made, a catch all amendment to the previous mandates and the logistical issues would be best composed in a single document.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
Would it be worth removing the idea of a main region entirely? And just have the world divided into three regions and then whichever region the chair is in, they can manage.
William Cooper - Galte: 
I’d support that
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I would be supportive of that.
The creation of an American ministry to facilitate that.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
, Mr Chair what are your thoughts on this conundrum?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's pretty much my proposition.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
In support
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would be supportive of it as well.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
the idea of the main region just seems a bit arbirtrary
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
friendly ghost: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would be willing to write this into law.
To present next session.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
plus this is also a good way to do away with any notions of the organsation being Americas-centered, in case anyone gets that idea in their minds
future members, etc
friendly ghost: 
I concur!
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
So what we have established is such:
Does everybody concur with this?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
friendly ghost: 
I do.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Aye.
William Cooper - Galte: 
Yea.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
Aye.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
Yep
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Excellent, so we've reached consensus.
I'm sorry for this, but I have yet another topic.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The floor is yours yet again.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I propose a change to the way deputy ministers are appointed. As opposed to the Chairman appointing a deputy minister, I believe it should be up to the regions minister to appoint their own deputy, in order to allow a stronger connection and partnership between minister and deputy.
William Cooper - Galte: 
I’m surprised this isn’t already policy.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would support that. The Chairman appointing deputies doesn’t make much sense at all.
friendly ghost: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Seems reasonable.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That will be all for my time on the floor. I'll be writing formal legislation for these proposals.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If we have nowt further, I shall adjourn at the turn of the hour.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
friendly ghost: 
Noted. It was an honour to attend my first session on behalf of the Unified Royal States of Australis.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
Id also like to state that it was an honour to attend on behalf of Nemkhavia at its first ever session of parliament.
friendly ghost: 
Congratulations <img loading="lazy" class="emoji " alt="🙂" title="slight_smile" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f642.svg">

This bill aims to amend our mission, adapting us to present time as an development alliance, as well as aligns us with the realities now posed by the Coronavirus outbreak.
Any discussion regarding this bill?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I support it.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
As do I.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
As do I.
Liam Alexander – Galte:

I concur with all hon. delegates as well.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I also concur.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I support this bill, all the revisions of the Mission in this bill are beneficial
It also provides some clafirication
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Mission was written during a time when the Alliance was considerably different compared to what it is now.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur.
sister.ray: 
If I may ask, why is the freedom of movement restricted presently?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That could pose a problem as it does not specifically say freedom of physical movement, and due to privacy and other requirements, it was just better to repeal the section instead of getting another possible legal event,
sister.ray: 
Another legal event? Has there been one before?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
No, but it is better just to avoid such event to occur.
A less vague version must also consider possible parameters including Discord rules, macronational visas, and other which can make it a lot more complicated.
Deleted User: 
That is understandable. I concur with the restriction with the reason of avoiding a possible legal event.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Is there any discussion regarding bill above?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I support it.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I support the act.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Have we had any incidents of a delegate below the age of 18 being harassed?
sister.ray: 
If I may?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Due to the classified events I can not answer this question at this time.
You have the floor.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Excuse me for the late response but I support this act.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If you can not awnser this question, then I don't have reason to believe that this is necessary.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We have had previous events in the GUM that made it useful for this act to be implemented.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
has the floor.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Sorry, I didn't see that message.
sister.ray: 
NSFW is a very internet culture word, and not really super helpful in actually describing the behavior we are trying to prevent. Explicit, inappripriate, etc. would  be much better words.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Consider elaborating on the term NSFW, by defining it or replace it.
Liam Alexander – Galte:

Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. Although I think this act is wrote in good intentions, I believe it is unneeded to have it's own Ministry. This act is great but could simply be a position sans ministry or within another such as homeland security.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
May I have the floor?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I have edited the act as necessary.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I yield the floor
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur, I do think it is best to consolidate it with the Ministry of Homeland Security.
You have the floor.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Atiera will be away for 10 minutes.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would like to mention that the act doesn't clarify that NSFW from other servers sent by a delegate would be considered a bad thing, I don't really care if a 18 year old posts NSFW in a completely different server in a NSFW channel.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That should also be defined as well.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Defined.
Shall I edit the act to remove the ministry of safeguarding but keep the Minister?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Ministers do require a Ministry to oversight (Article 39)
Perhaps make it an specialized position under the Ministry of Homeland Security?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted, wilco.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District’s other delegate is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Can I have opinions of the act with these changes implemented?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote"> This provides a risk of these delegates being harassed, bribed or abused by delegates above the age of 18
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright.
Sorry for the issues in the act, was tired when I wrote these.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Understandable.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It should be fixed now.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Noted

Liam Alexander – Galte: 
100% Support. Much needed as we will most likely be seeing a new Chair that is not from North America.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't see why we would have a ministry of American affairs unless a delegate that is not from a North America time zone is elected? Unless we want to guess who will win.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
It seems reasonable.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Thats... What this act is for... Ross and myself are not in America, making this change reasonable.
And as stated in the act, this ministry will only be active if a non American chair is in power.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Mr. Roscoe.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Sign up period is not closed yet.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
There is the likely chance that an non American chair is elected
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
So? It's still good to have in case future chairpeople are not from america.
James B. - Desert District: 
I much support this Act as several candidates for Chair are not in North America.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That doesn't affect the usefulness of this act in any way.
James B. - Desert District: 
This is a way to work with that to better the alliance’s scheduling.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
This isn't about the election. This is about future chairpeople.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with Jamez and Munroe.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would support it on the terms that a American ministry would be added if a delegate is not elected from North America.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
The act outlines exactly that.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's literally what it says, Mr Burdette.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur. The election results are not yet out, nor has it started. I kindly ask that Mr. Burdette forget about the election and focus on the purpose of the Act.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
No it doesn't say that. All it said is that a Ministry of American affairs will be created.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The region that the incumbent chairman resides in shall not have a minister and deputy minister.

If the act could be briefly summarized, I would appriciate it.

Hmm, should the (c) Mandates not be in the purview of the Ministry of Membership Attainment?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
For Ministers of Asian and Oceanian / European and African Affairs:
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Ministry of Membership Attainment is more focused to the handling of membership applications as opposed to marketing.

When discussing the possible revitalization of the Nacre service, and idea for a consolidated newspaper published bi-weekly (2 times a month) was brought up.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is this a replacement for Nacre, or a side project of sorts?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Newspress organizations in the CA who fit within the future news organization standard are planned to participate.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Most likely a side project. Nacre will be focused on the interior of the CA as well as original programming, whilst the tribune would be focused on contributions by various newspresses.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Could we try a 3 month trial? Where if the goal of being published 2 times a week is met we keep it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Possibly.
The Capstone Tribune newspaper will likely be under the revived Cupertino Press Association (which will be a standard which all newspresses under it need to follow) and the Nutmeg project will also likely be under the association.

Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Bi-weekly seems to be quite often. How long do you expect the publications to be?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Depends on how much people participate in it. If there isn't enough to deem satisfactory, it would likely be moved to monthly. We do prefer a couple news articles with some mini articles in it per issue.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That makes sense. There are a lot of us here, all working hard, but that seems like it could be hard to keep full consistently.

Alright then, let's move on.
Recently, a decrease regarding membership in the Asian and Oceanian sector has been noticed. The micronational community in Asia and Oceania in MW@D is minimal and are not joining the alliance. Does the delegates suggest any policy  changes to our approach to this sector or any platforms where there is a large amount of Asian and Oceanian members?
Ely: 
If I may is there a particular reason we ought to seek out nations in those areas other then there isn’t many?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This increases diplomacy between other nations, allows for more active Asian and Oceanian representation and knowledge related to the micronational community, etc.

Because it would create unnecessary administrative layers, as Honourable Delegate of Nemkhavia stated.
James B. - Desert District: 
A bit more decorum would be nice.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
All it does is shift what time zones “main” sessions are held.
Its not that big of a deal.
James B. - Desert District: 
Yeah it’s not really a huge burden or major administrative layer.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I support the Main Region Act, it seems reasonable and it's already de facto in place.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
But securing it in the event an individual outside of the incumbent’s continent wins the Chair election is very beneficial.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I have one concern, what happens to the minister of that regions affairs when a chairman is elected from that region?
Marka Mejakhansk: 
I would suggest that the chair should be concerned with the running of the organisation as a whole, and not with the governance of their particular area as per this act as, if I read it correctly, that region loses their Minister.
James B. - Desert District: 
 What is your solution to the fact that someone in Australia or Asia, just anywhere far from North America, would potentially have to wake up at 3:00 AM to lead a session?
How can we avoid this without this act?

This has been stated before, but please be sure to maintain decorum in sessions.

Let the area keep their Minister and have the Chair still chair the sessions if they wish.

None from Desert District.

Well I would support creating the office of Speaker, who will be chosen by the Chairman. So the Speaker will in fact lead sessions instead of Chair.

Now that seems like an unnecessary administrative layer.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Isn't that the point of Deputy Ministers, to fill in the role of a minister if they lose the position or are absent?

I think what we’re hitting on here is the role of the Chair in the larger organisation vs the role of the chair in meetings.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The role of the chair in sessions depends on which type of session:
LamentTwice: 
The Chair should definitely be concerned with the main sessions and running of the org.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
I know I’m a relatively recent blow-in to the Alliance so I wouldn’t seek to impose a view on this, I’d just like to see the Ministries stay regardless of where the Chair happens to Be
James B. - Desert District: 
Yeah, I’m wondering why the two people who are against this are the only two new people here.

I have an additional comment on this act.
I believe the Chairman should be the Minister of their respective region.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I support it.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Apologies for my tardiness, but Monmark is present. 
fvck: 
I support it aswell.
James B. - Desert District: 
The CA being an alliance that <strong>should</strong> be accessible having 4 hour sessions clogged by nations founded last week is not good.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I support this.
James B. - Desert District: 
This is an effective solution.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I support the act.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I support this motion as well
Marka Mejakhansk: 
I support it.
LamentTwice: 
I support this motion.
I don’t believe we should discuss nations founded in a short time before the time of the session, it wastes time.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Does anyone have any further comment, or do we see fit to proceed to the next reading?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
None from me
LamentTwice: 
None from me.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Then we shall begin the second reading for the <strong>Deputy Ministerial Act</strong>.

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur with this act.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I support the act.
Deleted User: 
I abstain.
fvck: 
I will also abstain.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I support
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I support the act.
LamentTwice: 
I too will abstain.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
It may not be necessary in most cases.
James B. - Desert District: 
A Minister working with their Deputy Minister effectively is important, and this will allow this to happen.
James B. - Desert District: 
But it is in some. And there’s no cons to this unless you can think of one.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Hausgurd is now present.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Well, we may not have the resources for the potential of positions.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The position already exists.
This simply transfers the duty of appointment from the Chair of the Board to the relevant ministers.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
If one can even concur to an objective fact.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I have been branching off a bit.
It seems as if it would put less weight off the shoulders of the Chair.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have anything further, or do we see fit to proceed?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
None from me
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
None from me
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
What if a person who is appointed as Deputy Minister by a Minister is not really fit for the position?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Well then should the Chair should be able to executively remove them?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I oppose this act.
James B. - Desert District: 
This is why Chair approval is required.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It should be the duty of the Minister to appoint a subordinate, not the Chair's.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I think you meant that you support this act.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
There shouldn't need to be approval from the Chair.
Amend Article &#167;43 of the Cupertino Alliance Charter to allow a minister to appoint their deputy, with approval from the Chairman of the Board.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Reasonable then
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I think that could significantly help prevent corruption as long as the Chair is a competent person.
James B. - Desert District: 
Ah that is a fair point.
Not sure where I stand.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
But the competence of the Chair is an issue for a different time.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I shall offer up a final call for further comments before we proceed forth.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
None from me
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
None from me
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
None from I.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
None from Saspearian.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present, apologies for the truancy.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
With that, we shall begin a set of discussions on various ideas brought up during the 48th Cupertino Alliance Session, after which we shall debate the single membership application.
First one the table, is the proposed establishment of the <strong>Capstone Tribune</strong> proposed by the Chairman.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The floor is yours.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thank you
The Capstone Tribune newspaper aims at consolidating 2 weeks worth of news relating to CA members into one document, making it easier to read, as well as using it as a platform to get more viewership. The project will likely be under the revived Cupertino Press Association (which will be a standard which all newspresses under it need to follow) and the Nutmeg project will also likely be under the association. Nacre will also likely get revived but be focused on more original broadcasting as well as be focused into the interior of the CA.
A design mockup was made for this proposed project. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NqaWURi6ly0GZfhZddKqzjZ-MqBFQ3qIfNnoOx05cqE/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NqaWURi6ly0GZfhZddKqzjZ-MqBFQ3qIfNnoOx05cqE/edit?usp=sharing</a>

All news articles in the mockup are fake.
I yield the floor.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Would this program use a website?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Most likely not, if we did a blog style service it would get pretty long to read, leading to less viewership. Doing it on a document allows for easier archiving and reading.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Would this be similar to the Nutmeg project in that individuals can submit articles relating to their country, or will articles be curated by the Cupertino Press Association?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Would be similar to the Nutmeg project, but we do plan to integrate some original broadcasting exclusive to the paper (though it will not be the main focus of the paper).
friendly ghost: 
Apologies for my delay, but I am now present on behalf of Australis.
What are we discussing presently?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Capstone Tribune.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
How would the Capstone Tribune differentiate itself from Nacre?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Well, nacre is Inactive currently.
friendly ghost: 
Why do we have so many different news programs anyway?
Isn’t Capstone like the fourth or fifth one?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Tribune would be based more on the members of the CA and contributed by various news organizations, as well as be in paper form, Nacre would be focused on the interior proceedings of the CA, on wordpress, and would feature original broadcasting.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Why don't we merge these news programs together under the nutmeg program or something?
If we do that with different branches it would be simpler.
friendly ghost: 
I concur with the honorable Aenopian delegate
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The problem is that Nutmeg is a program, the latter two are newspapers.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
What about making the newspapers subsidiaries of the program then under branches?
friendly ghost: 
Well, Nutmeg allows for news submissions from member nations, right? Why not allow submissions from the organization itself? Create an internal newspaper, it’s a simple solution.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
There are plans to consulate press to the Cupertino Press Association.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Understandable.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That is the purpose of Nacre. However, Capstone provides a medium to allow us to send the combined newspaper to a Discord news channel or the MicroWiki front page as opposed to 50 different articles, leading to more viewership.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The problem with Nutmeg is that it is just a discord webhook, and as such is not widely accessible outside certain servers.
friendly ghost: 
So Capstone is to Nacre as Mustang is to Khasmin (in Molossia)?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I do not understand your comparison.
friendly ghost: 
A monthly(?) summary of smaller news documents.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
friendly ghost: 
I’d support that, then.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Fantastic.
friendly ghost: 
It sounded at first like Capstone was yet another news project but it seems like it would really pair well with Nacre.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Does anyone have any further comment on the <strong>Capstone Tribune</strong> proposal?
sister.ray: 
I agree with the sentiment that consolidation of these things into one thing would make more sense.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
friendly ghost: 
No further comment from Australis, considering the other delegates are likely asleep.
sister.ray: 
Rather than a proliferation of further iterations of news media sources.
friendly ghost: 
I concur.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Scroll up.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I scrolled up.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That would be correct.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
The Capstone Tribune proposal would be very beneficial to newspapers from CA Member States.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I see fit to proceed with the agenda.
would you like the floor?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes please.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The floor is yours.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The standard (will be called the Cupertino Press Association and will consulate Nutmeg and other press related items) will consist of basic standards in fact checking, grammar, and other standards to ensure that programs like Capstone maintain their quality we aim for. The standard will likely be a requirement for all CA press related programs.
I yield the floor.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Does the present delegation offer comment on this proposal.
friendly ghost: 
No comment.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

If we have no further comment, I will proceed in the interests of timeliness.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
None from Saspearian
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Our next item on the agenda is the topic of future policy regarding the declining <strong>Asian and Oceanian Sector</strong>, as noted by the chair in the previous session.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We should be encouraging activity within this sector as it's malnourished as it is.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Humberlea is present.
friendly ghost: 
Daniel and I have discussed this in private and I share his high concern for the sector’s future.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We unlike our GUM counterparts have a larger Asian sector which we should continue to nourish and prioritise.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe membership itself in the Asian Sector is waning, due to recent events
James B. - Desert District: 
What event?...
I’m forgetting something.
friendly ghost: 
I am also unaware.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Is it the Indonesia stuff?
James B. - Desert District: 
Ahhhh.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Lese Majeste events in Thailand leading to the departure of Orientia, and the Dhrubajyoti Roy scandal leading to his suspension from the Alliance.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
Ah yes that’s true.
friendly ghost: 
Millania was removed by vote of no confidence, right? I’m somewhat unaware of the events surrounding this.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
I concur
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes, due to inactivity.
friendly ghost: 
Unfortunate.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
They do plan to reapply if I recall.
James B. - Desert District: 
I doubt they’ll be any different seeing as they got more than 1 warning.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Does anyone offer any potential solutions?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would support them as an observer however even then when they were downgraded we saw no change except from a statement asking not to be removed.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
A delegate who is active.
friendly ghost: 
I concur. <img loading="lazy" class="emoji " alt="hahu" title="hahu" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/emojis/727707494595559487.png">
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I shall offer a couple of minutes for any comments before we move on.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I suppose more advertising to Asian-rich areas, but I do not really know what are them to be honest.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We could try organise an agreement of sorts with ASPAA.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
May I ask what happened with Mr Roy? I know it’s not strictly the issue at hand but I’ve heard a lot of talk about this but no actual information.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I apologize for my absence, I was eating lunch, however, Monmark is no longer present.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
Or is there anywhere I can go to find said info?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I don’t know the whole situation.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The lack of information is intentional, and shall likely remain such.
James B. - Desert District: 
Confidential for the time being.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
Understood
James B. - Desert District: 
Could be permanently.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's so confidential that I don't even know and I'm the Lieutenant Chair.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
I respect that, no problem
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I intend to move to the next topic.
There are currently vacancies for a few offices within the alliance, such being the <strong>Ministry of Homeland Affairs</strong>, <strong>Ministry of Technology</strong> and the <strong>Ministry of Public Affairs</strong>.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think we should wait until after the elections have concluded to elect a new Superior Judge.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I don’t think Smith is coming back anytime soon.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am unaware of what Zed plans during his alleged return in January.

I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If we have nowt further, then I shall move on.
We shall now discuss the Amendments to the Cupertino Service Ribbon proposed and discussed in previous sessions.

Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
I would support this
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I support this.
James B. - Desert District: 
I don’t have the time to fill that out always.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Except for the last provision
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Last provision was meant as a radical one.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
My problem with this is that assessing the results will be more difficult. The prior format automatically produced graphs allowing for ease of assessment. 
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I think that most of us view our time in AM and PM.
Or at least the majority of us.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have anything further before we proceed to membership applications?

Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
As I stated in yesterday’s session, I support the act.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with the honorable delegate of Monmark
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur with Mr. Shepard and believe this act will help reduce session time and prevent the Ministry of Membership Attainment from being overloaded which could effect the quality of remarks.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with the above delegate.

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I support this act.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I oppose this act.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Please state why.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It is the role of the Minister to appoint a subordinate without approval from the Chair
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
So you're saying that a Minister can go and appoint someone who is totally unqualified for the role, and/or never active within the Alliance, without Chairman approval?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
How do you know the Chair will ensure quality either?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I assume the Chair will examine their performance in the Alliance.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Considering that the organization elected the Chair at large, it should be safe to assume that the Chair will only approve those he views as favorable to the Alliance. If he doesn’t, he isn’t doing his job in my opinion, but that opens up a completely different discussion.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The Minister still gets to chose ultimately who gets to be their deputy, but having Chair approval is a safeguard measure to prevent someone not suitable for the role getting in, due to bias or unprofessionality.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with Mr. Shepard. His point is highly valid.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I would be fine with the bill if the provision that the Chair can unilaterally appoint a Deputy Minister was removed
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This act gives more freedom to Ministers, but ensures that that freedom is not abused.
The Chairman can approve a nomination
Nothing in the bill states that the Chair can unilaterally appoint a Deputy Minister.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Ah I misread the body
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
What is your take on the act then? Still oppose?

Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah. This project will unify news broadcasts and allow for greater interconnection between delegations.
Righty, is that all on this topic?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I have nothing more to say on the matter.

It's rather something to make news published to the CA of a higher quality.
LamentTwice: 
Alright.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'll move on now if there's no other discussion.
Moving on, we will discuss Future policy towards Asian and Oceanian sector
Over the course of the last few weeks, this sector has rapidly declined.
Milannia was expelled, and Vishwamitra was expelled.
Orientia was forced to leave.
The stricter Thai rules have damaged the Alliance's Thai members.

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I am not aware on how to fix the lack of Asian and Oceanian nation? We could encourage Asian and Oceanian nations to join but I doubt that would have a effect.
Bojo May: 
We could offer it to them
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I would like to encourage a partnership with organisations such as ASPAA and ASAM.
Bojo May: 
Good idea
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I do not believe a partnership with ASAM specifically is a good idea, considering the current Chair is Mr. Roy of Vishwamitra, if I am not mistaken.

Hm.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You're correct. However, other nations in the ASAM could still be invited.

Agreed.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any more discussion on this?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis:

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let's move on.

<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Let's get some discussion on this matter, we still have a few topics remaining.
Also, this is the 50th session, let's make this a great one!
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
What are the opening?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe that I have expressed this previously, but I am interested in being considered for the role of Minister of Technology.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I am back from cooking. What's new?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">There are currently vacancies for a few offices within the alliance, such being the Ministry of Homeland Affairs, Ministry of Technology and the Ministry of Public Affairs.
LamentTwice: 
I wanted to give a short speech on the topic of 50 sessions.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Please wait until the end of the session. Thank you.

I haven't been in the server long enough to know quite a bit on the matters at hand. I hope the right person is found to fill these rolls.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I apologise for my disappearance.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
for Minister of Public Affairs, if he chose to accept it.
I also believe I talked to someone from the Monmarkian delegation regarding the Minister of Technology.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Yes, we have talked previously.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
considering his extensive experience with technology.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Does the delegacy have any say in the appointment of officials?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
There is no-one that I have talked to for Minister of Homeland Affairs except for Jamez, although he's now acting Superior Judge.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What do the ministries do?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Handle various aspects of the Alliance.
Much like Government ministries.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Yes of course, but the individual ones?
A ministry of homeland security strikes me more as something which concerns a nation alone, and not a supranational authority.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe a delegate has inquired about one of the ministries.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
My understanding is that the ministry doesn’t relate to security specifically, but all internal affairs to the alliance.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Homeland affairs, right sorry.
friendly ghost: 
I would love to, but no thanks.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra:

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette:

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any more discussion on this matter?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Nowt from I.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I'd endorse king Munroe for the homeland affairs position.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
None from I.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe Munroe retracted his wish to take office.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I see.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I wish to take said office but will not be running until a new chair is sworn in
Thanks though, Mr. Miller.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Shall we now move on, then?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe so.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Then let's continue onto our next topic on the agenda.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
As I’ve stated in its previous readings, I support the measure.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like this to be amended to include a defined criteria for the Citizen Class ribbon, which seems to be largely forgotten.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
An amendment for the amendment? Interesting.
Any more discussion on this?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I think that is called a Amendment of the Second Rank.
None from I.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright.
Final discussion before membership applications.
<strong>Session optimization amendments</strong>
<div class="pre pre--multiline nohighlight">Some delegates have complained that the session optimization forms are quite lengthy and hard to fill them out. In order to attain information, should the forms be changed to any of these below?:
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am completely against this.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I oppose the act as well.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I do not think the form is excessively long.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's fine, and using local time will massively complicate things.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This needlessly fiddles with a simple process and provides far less accurate times, especially during a time when sessions draw on for hours and participation is minimal as a result.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with Mr Valentinus.

Now that is where we disagree, since I don't believe that serious-satire spectrum matters in micronationalism

James B. - Desert District: 
I think there is a severe flaw with something like this.
An opinion is not gone because a SJ cannot publicly express it,
a bias is not gone because a SJ cannot publicly express it,
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Point of order?
James B. - Desert District: 
if anything, having the SJ be able to state their personal out-of-the-court opinions makes potential biases clearer.
I yield the floor.

So would this make sure future summits are scheduled so that a lot of people can attend?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Liam Alexander – Galte: 
The PASTA act is an act to establish a new program to foster diplomacy within the alliance. It promotes the scheduling of summits, a big one being summits that are in person. If you may remember the CA summit between Humberlea and the CA, many treaties were signed. That's what I want to see more of. In addition, in these tough times of the COVID-19 Pandemic (and cases rapidly increasing once again), we must play it safely. Alas, I hope to also plan some virtual summits.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Good question. I'm not sure if you are familiar with the GUM sister cities project, but the groups  will basically be chosen collectively by delegates. For example, if I wanted to participate in this on behalf of Atiera, I would contact Matachewan, Aenderia and Humberlea to see if they would like to participate in said group. Alternatively, you can apply and be paired at random

I believe there was a proposal earlier this year presented by the honourable Ivan Brienovich called the Twin Towns project. I cannot recall whether the notion was successful, failed, or was stricken out by the Great Repeal Bill.

This is much different than the twin towns or whatever. I was only using the GUM sister cities project as an example of how nations would be paired.

Session moderation should be left to the Speaker.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Please please please implement this. I can not stress my frustration. I think the chair of the session should be moderator
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

Penalizing would probably be a last resort.

I have no opinion on this matter.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Speaker has a specific duty and if they don't see something as decorum or not then it should be final.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I wholeheartedly agree with this
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The fact delegates have taken an active role to promote decorum is rather commendable, given our.. former reputation.

Deleted User: 
That isn't the problem
James B. - Desert District: 
Then what is?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Though it shouldn't be an reason to deny an nation it is unrealistic
Deleted User: 
Its their underdevelopment
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's the point of micronations. We can be as wacky and eccentric as we want.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Its a micronation. Leeway is usually given regarding these matters.
James B. - Desert District: 
We’re very developed.
You can see the website.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
But should we really trust them?
James B. - Desert District: 
Why would we not?
Deleted User: 
Let them have their internal affairs, we shouldn't judge them by that
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
What're they gonna do? Give you capital punishment?
James B. - Desert District: 
l concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
They can’t really do that.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Exactly.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
However, I do like that their doing things seriously now within their server.
James B. - Desert District: 
I think the website shows and proves we are quite developed with many cultural niches.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
For example are you going to think Australis should be expelled for our dogs having royal titles?
We can have unrealistic things, it's micronationalism
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
It can be quite interfering with some nations though.
James B. - Desert District: 
The whole idea of micronationalism is pretending we have our own countries, unrealistic aspects are a weird thing to criticize.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I didn’t start my Micronation to pretend to have my country.
I wanted to actually have a sovereign entity.
But the point is that I have some concerns about them, but there are some positives.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Shall we get on topic though now?
James B. - Desert District: 
Noted.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Elaborate
da lilist UwU bean: 
can i leave?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark just call itself sovereign, without labels like micronation or secessionist, so it is in my view that criticism of stuff like in Kodrolia is not fair to them.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You may leave at any time.
Have a nice day.

Any final discussion towards applicant above?

None from myself
James B. - Desert District: 
Yes.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted.
James B. - Desert District: 
To say there’s no info on culture when there is on the website is an interring decision.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I didn't write the remarks, take it to the Ministry.
James B. - Desert District: 
Is that Mr. Montan?
I’m genuinely not sure.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Montan would be minister responsible.
James B. - Desert District: 
Noted.

Any discussion regarding act above?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am wholly against this.
James B. - Desert District: 
If someone is being unprofessional in a session there’s no reason to stop an admin member from preventing it.
It lowers our professionalism which sets a dangerous precedent.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Yes, the speaker should take charge in his session, but to penalise other delegates for taking initiative and self-enforcing decorum is absolutely absurd.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am willing to go so far to say it is mainly through this practice post-parliamentary-practice- act we ended up gettting this far in terms of professionalism.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You have valid points but penalizing delegates would be used as a last ditch resort. This rule is in place to prevent the situation getting worse. If there is an decorum complaint by a delegate, they can always private message the Speaker. Please elaborate on your third point.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Purposely antagonising delegates is already covered in the charter. There isn't really much to elaborate on there.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted, just didn't understand how it was worded.
Another reason this rule is being proposed is that the Speaker is accountable through votes of no confidence. If an normal delegate minimodded but the claim was false then it would be way harder to make them accountable.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Nevertheless, I simply cannot support such an amendment in good faith.

Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Session starting soon.
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Alright then, the guide to hosting a session does not specify what do to do if no members take attendance (although it does say it is not compulsory), and I have waited 5 minutes. I understand that given the Christmas period many people will be unable to attend, but many members are showing as online. Therefore I will wait another 5 minutes and then commence with the agenda, in the hope that someone might join or I receive instructions from a superior as to what to do.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" style="color: rgb(94, 197, 171); background-color: rgba(94, 197, 171, 0.1);">@Members</span>
Right, still no members in attendance.
I will start with the agenda.
Item 1 is the Second Reading of the Amendment Realignment Act.
Amendment Realignment Act</div>

To me this seems a logical process, necessary to standardise the way we name Amendments, and the Act has my support.
Any comments?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Right, still no attendance, but moving on to Item 2 of the Agenda.
The Planned Agreements for Summits, Trades and Allies Draft.
PASTA Act</div>

I think this Act has potential, and would be interested to see what it is like when Mr Munroe finishes it.
The pairing of nations in close geographical proximity for in-person and virtual relationships would be a interesting avenue to explore, as, apart from the Noted project, the Alliance during the time I have been in it has not really done anything related to this that I know of.
Any comments?
Joseph Peto - Hausgurd: 
Right, due to the low attendance and (understandable) lack of activity, I am adjourning the session. I will try to arrange to have this session rescheduled to a time when more members will be able to attend.

Looking at their MW page, they seem alright to an extent.

Ah.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
However I think that this section seems a bit concerning:
Deleted User: 
It is.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Yikes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If they have only started to experience stability recently then surely it's a bit of cause for concern?
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I do believe that was in reference to Almendria.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That combined with their age is very concerning
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The 6 Month Rule is no longer a requirement. '6-Months worth of development' is the alternative requirement.

Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I believe that it was in reference to Almendria, which not even Monmark could avoid.

I think I'm going to abstain during the voting based on this knowlege.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette:

Either way, as a delegate representing Monmark, I would have to oppose the idea of Kodrolia joining the Cupertino Alliance.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I will abstain on this for the reasons of possible bias, and due to possible unification.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's rather unfair if you ask me.

Not very developed.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I had some concerns about the laws in the previous reading, but I think a better description would be significantly different from the laws of Cupertino Alliance Members.

Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I am referring to Tinakula.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The fact that they need to point out homocide rates is rather dubious.
Deleted User: 
I'm not one to entertain rumors, but pray tell, what are they?
Deleted User: 
Very.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Their leader has quite a few accusations of barring people for humiliating him and also political dissidents
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yikes.
I shall be voting no.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
It should also be noted that this appears to be the second or third iteration of Tinakula in the matter of months, based on their posts on r/micronations.
Deleted User: 
Yes, I see, corruption and homicide. A perfect candidate. I will be voting no.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I haven’t seen it in a micronation in a while.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I cannot stress enough how much I disapprove of tinakula
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur with the delegate of New Athens.
Deleted User: 
As a Micronational Leader, I do allow my citizens this right just because I cannot take it away from them.
Deleted User: 
I concur also.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They have an entire section dedicated to crisises and it's too long to even copy half of it into here.
Definitely a no from me.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
They have been an ongoing topic within the LIN because they just keep getting worse. Election rigging just to name one issue
LamentTwice: 
I disagree with the admission of Tinakula.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark was last unstable in 2018.

Their claims aren’t sensible enough.

I am not a part of LIN but I concur.

Given the leader jailing dissidents for what I believe to be l&#232;se-majest&#233; against him, I shall vote no as well.

Rather Stubby and Undeveloped.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
They hardly seem developed, thus I will be voting against them.

Also they didn't crop their flag very well but that's just a small note.

The Ponderosan dollar is officially pegged at 1/30 of a US dollar, and I hold about a million of them- do currency exchange rates really matter?

Yes.
They do.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It depends really.
If you claim to hold x amount of moneys and they're worth 1/x of a fiat currency, are they really worth that much?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
No- that's the point.
Plenty of macronations have dubious official exchange rates, look at Iran.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I read that as micronations for a moment.
At the end of the day it relies on how seriously you want to take the claims really.

I was questioning the seriousness of the act regarding its name.

It would be a big blow to our reputation if this was published under the PASTA act name.
LamentTwice: 
As stated before, other people could attack us with that name
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I am a little concerned by the need to register trades under the act. Lundenwic is currently trades independently and is planning to open an online shop soon. Would these purchases need to be noted?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that it's just for trade between member states.
Either way the act is poorly executed regardless.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Indeed. But if other nations buy our goods would it be liable for citation?

I believe that it's only for sanctioned trading rather than 'informal' trading.

Future amendments will not be legally bound to this convention, but rather by informal tradition... which has lead to issues in the past where our legal code has had to be patched up by later acts, such as the Parliamentary Procedures Act.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You raise a valid point, Mr Valentinus. Perhaps the author of the bill could add a clause stating future amendments must be named by these conventions.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Such informal plans have a large possibility of being lost, especially with the upcoming transition of power.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
or maybe just draft a second act, to be discussed in the next meeting, that standardises future acts. that way, the standardisation of previous acts is pushed more quickly
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Amending the standing Act seems much more sensible, in my opinion. Less time has to be spent on two things that essentially say the same thing.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I don't see why it can't be added into this one. This is the final reading - if we can get it in before voting, it'd be far more efficient.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
very well
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Forgive me, but I am unaware of normal procedure. If the act is amended, must it be read three times again?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
In honesty, I am not entirely sure.
It might not be codified.
Let me refer to the Charter.
Deleted User: 
Monmark is Present.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Seeing as the point of readings are to scruntinise the proposals, it would be logical for this to not be the case.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I don't seem to see anything, which I have noted for investigation.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Thank you
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Do any delegates wish to submit any more discussion to this bill?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This is yet another example at how the legal holes affect our legal system.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Certainly. The Charter may be a work of art, but it is imperfect.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Not necessarily. Being aware of the legal holes within the system and still being able to function within these constraints is fine.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
yes, but it takes one bad person to abuse a loophole for personal gain
which could be very damaging to the CA
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
It is more important that we are aware and work together to fix the charter and prevent further situations arising.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Everything could go well, until it doesn't.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I mean, yes, but ignoring legal holes never leads to anything good. Note the Articles of Confederation in early US History.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
legal holes must be fixed before the next Adolf comes along
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I never said ignore them.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
A bit extreme, but your logic is agreeable.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
well
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I merely stated that we can still function within the legal framework.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
the problem is that the bad people in politics are often the extreme
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
While this is true, I see no concern here that there is an 'adolf' within the membership.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Perhaps it be wise we proceed to the next reading?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted, but I believe we have strayed from our original topic.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Does anyone wish to submit further discussion on this act?
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I do not.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let's move on, then.
The next topic on the agenda is <strong>Transitioning to the Ross administration</strong>. 
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
How can we meaningfully contribute to this when it is only really concerns the outgoing Chair and their team and the incoming Chair and their team?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
As someone who’s largely unaware of what the two parties have already been doing, and I’m sure most other delegates are in that boat too, I find it hard to offer any meaningful suggestions as to the transition.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Members voted for the incoming Chair and will hold him accountable throughout his tenancy.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe it was awarded unanimously due to the lack of opposition.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
That is true. Forgive my forgetfulness.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes, I dropped out due to external factors/stress.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wholly concur with the points raised by the other delegates.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
well, the only thing we can really do that is somewhat meaningful is giving our full support to the new party
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I hope the outgoing Chair assists the incoming Chair as much as possible, is what I suppose my sentiment would be.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur. This is what I was instructed to present as per the agenda, however I shall hold a vote to skip this.
It's clear that it's not a discussion that we can really engage with.
All those in favour of skipping this discussion, say Aye.
Aye.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
aye
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Aye
friendly ghost: 
Aye
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Aye
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Then it is decided, we shall move on.
Next on the agenda is the discussion of the Cupertino Alliance News Standard draft, written by Jayden Lycon. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GnOTmWFKWfuM8QqyA3i_Enjs34XNp9rbjKMjcLZVhxM/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1GnOTmWFKWfuM8QqyA3i_Enjs34XNp9rbjKMjcLZVhxM/edit</a>
News standard draft</div>
Communication News organizations will be required to disclose publicly and in the article: Any sponsor or payment / gift made for an article If this article is an opinion, oped, or simply an article based upon sourced facts  Referencing News organizations agree to hereby adopt the standard o...</div>
This is intended to provide regulations for member state news published in the Cupertino Alliance,  if I have interpreted it correctly.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe I recall this being brought to parliament a month or two ago.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It has since been updated, I believe.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I support the standard.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I have one suggestion, which is to add a bit of text to the clause of fact checking, to ensure that a news cooperation will not condone a direct call for violence.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I wholly concur.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
in light of recent events and stuff
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Wait, would we need to sign up to this standard or would it automatically apply to our nation?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe requiring APA Style referencing is unnecessary. The practice is rare amongst Micronational  newspapers, and given that several events take place in on-line chatrooms such as discord, several key events would be unable to be verified under these regulations, and as such be deemed ineligible.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe it would be if you are utilising the Cupertino Alliance news services to distribute your news.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I agree with this point. MLA and APA are normally used for law or scientific papers and should not really count for news publications. Perhaps just a link to any references would suffice.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
We would not be comfortable with disclosing our sponsors and would like to refrain from using this service.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Should the referencing requirements be made lax, would support this. At present, I am unable to support this as it would disqualify nearly all cupertino news sources and negatively affect the nutmeg program as a result.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
i concur
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As would I, I do not wish to participate in the program under such regulations.
It needs heavy editing to represent the will of the delegates.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Is there any further discussion on the News Standard?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe it’d be a better idea to have a designated editor(s) to review articles before publication
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Until the issues are rectified, I have no further comment on the current draft of this bill.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
MLA and APA format is unnecessary in my opinion for a news article
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
An interesting idea, but they would still need standards with which to work by.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I guess that is true
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Right, shall we move on now?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I believe so.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, next on the agenda is the draft of the PASTA Act. This act is not completed yet. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15XPxFjXegWP_9w5LBk2ZHUtoaZQ6MhF59Yb9EEWw0rI/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/15XPxFjXegWP_9w5LBk2ZHUtoaZQ6MhF59Yb9EEWw0rI/edit</a>
PASTA Act</div>
Cupertino Alliance Planned Agreements for Summits, Trade, and Allies Act  Statutes of the Cupertino Alliance, 2020 Published by Authority                    Copyright Statement The Cupertino Alliance Printer holds copyright on behalf of the Government of the Cupertino Alliance and her membe...</div>
Discussion on how to improve and add to the act is requested.
friendly ghost: 
The name really should be changed, in the name of seriousness.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe it should, but I think it's also functional.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
The name does not denote unprofessionalism to me. It is a handy moniker.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
But the act seems to be half finished. I do not see anything for Trade or Alliances.
friendly ghost: 
Yeah, I agree. I can see both sides of the argument.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah, it's a draft.
Incomplete at this stage, it is up for discussion to add more to the act.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I see. While it ruins the title of the act, I really do not think that the CA should be ruling on a nation's trading or who they ally themselves with.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur, but I am not entirely sure if that is how the act is intended to be seen as.
for more information.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Also point 3.4 seems to have accidently crept in from the trade portion of the act.
Personally I do think the CA can regulate summits &amp; meets to ensure the safety of the members here, be they minors or adults.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah, the newly established Safeguarding Officer would have a large role in that.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Perfect. Until I see a more finished act, I can comment no further.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It is concerning that after nearly three reading, the bill is still incomplete.
Alas, I have no comment.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This is very concerning. Is there a limit to how many times an act can be read? Does this now have to be voted on?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It is labelled as a discussion and not a reading in the Agenda.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Again sorry for all the questions. I am still rather new to the CA.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's totally understandable. Don't need to apologise.
Is there any further comment on the PASTA act draft?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I have no further comments.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, let's move on to the next part of the agenda.
Next up is discussion of Amendment XII (LGBTQ+)
Amendment XII (LGBTQ+ recognition)</div>
Cupertino Alliance Amendment XII (LGBTQ+ recognition) Statues of the Cupertino Alliance, 2020 Published by Authority                     Copyright Statement The Cupertino Alliance Printer holds copyright on behalf of the Government of the Cupertino Alliance and her member states.

<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Is there any discussion on this act?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
While I am not in favour of the wording, the content is well intended and is something I can support.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
it looks good
I would support it
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Atiera is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Looking at it, I see that this is a ploy to implement the withdrawn Amendment XI, to disallow 'minimodding'.
Sorry I didn't read the second part.
Disregard my concern for this. Otherwise, I support this.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I see. I mean most of us will not have the means to 'minimod'. We still have the right to challenge the behaviour of members as set forth in the act though.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted. Is there any more discussion on this proposal?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Not from I.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let us move on now, then.
Next up is Establishment of dedicated sessions for memberships
I am heavily against this. We already have enough sessions as it is.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I agree. This seems like an heavy-handed approach to a simple problem.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur with the delegate from Australis.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Is the problem that too much time is being spent discussing applications?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We don't want to oversaturate the Alliance with sessions.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe this is the reason, but my Executive Rejection act should deal with this.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Well perhaps members can be given the chance to post their endorsements (explanations behind how they intend to vote) in the sessions, rather than having a discussion. Then you can have a separate channel for actively discussing the applications, their merits, etc.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
and <span class="mention">#deleted-channel</span> which was abandoned.
Logan Ross plans to bring them back though.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
These are not very clearly labelled. I had no idea what those channels were meant to represent.
I have always loathed membership application discussions because in most cases there is enormous debate, that does not change the way a member intends to vote, and a relatively brief outcome.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I do agree with you massively.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I apologise for my undue absence. The power had run out.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted, welcome back, Mr Valentinus.
Do you have anything to comment on this?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe dedicated membership sessions at this stage is not necessary.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Shall we now move on?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
By all means.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Moving on now, we have discussion for the Associate Judge nomination.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">In which I have been nominated for Associate Judge, which is now being voted on in <span class="mention">#voting-hall</span>
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have full support for this nomination, and believe the nominee would serve an excellent job.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is partially present
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Mr. Valentinus.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
With the latter, I believe it was a mere mistake on the part of Jamez who hasn't used this system before.
Is there any more on this topic?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Sorry, no.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let's move on then.
Next up is the use of trusted retail stores (Sells seeds, costs cheap, no custom duties, local, reputable) for the GreenCities program.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As in.... are we approving shops?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Hmmm
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Seeing the public opinion on using these stores for GreenCities as opposed to the previous model used
due to the reasons listed above
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Good day, Aenderia is present.
The GreenCities program grants funding to only approved and trusted shops. Applicants request an subsidy and we will pay it only through a certified shop.
Currently, we only have a certified shop that ships to Canada, the US, and Mexico.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Lundenwic has a seed repository that was procured through trading with a nation called Laylandiistan &amp; Gurvata.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Interesting.
Aenderia is no longer present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I can confirm the seeds we have stored at a later date. We can also ship within the UK and possibly Europe.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That sounds like an interesing thing you've got going on.
Shall we now move on to membership applications?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I find this amusing given my earlier comments surrounding membership applications.
But yes, please continue.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
First up is the third reading of Aarland.
Federal Republic of Aarland
Aarland Republic</div>
Aarland, officially the Federal Republic of Aarland (Russian: Федеративная республика Аарланд; German: Bundesrepublik Aarland;  Anaslavian: Federǎl Republika če &#197;rland), is a federal republic of four administrates and one federal district.

If there is not a suitable amount of activity I see that it may be wise to adjourn the session.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Sorry, I was reading the information provided.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
The Microwiki page seems fairly underdeveloped.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Oh, my bad.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
A basic consitution and an underdeveloped MW page. I do not know anymore about them and I am not sure of the requirements for membership.
Is it easy to expel members that break the rules or show continued unprofessional behaviour?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If they violate the charter then yeah
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
That is something that I will keep in consideration when voting.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next up
The third reading for Tinakula.
Socialist States of Tinakula 
Socialist States of Tinakula</div>

I'm highly against Tinakula.
Due to the fact that I non stop see rubbish on the micronations subreddit on them
And they're highly unstable.
friendly ghost: 
Reddit sector cringe and a horrible MW page? That’s enough for an instant NO from me.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I do not know of this nation, but trust in the opinions of the members above.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Decorum, but your point is logical.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yes I am especially concerned with all their drama as of recent, also the fact they claim quite a few islands I doubt they have jurisdiction over.
Land claim for reference
friendly ghost: 
Aye. Naveria claims an island, but it’s in the middle of a lake just three miles north of the capital city. It’s not a massive island chain like, well, that.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Genuine??
That's outrageously large.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
If there is time at the end of the meeting may I present a few things to discuss mr. Speaker?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Yes, following <span class="mention" title="Lord Lewis (PM of Lundenwic)#1538">@Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic</span>.
Anyways, moving on.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
That was what was shown on their Microwiki.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Leo, second reading.

Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I support their entry into the alliance, they have an active government which I am a part of.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Ah, excellent.
Could you explain their nation more? There's not a lot of info here.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Thank you for your honesty about possible conflicts of interest.
I am a little worried that their MW page states they are currently in The Inactive State era.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Well the nation was revived by a previous leader in November, I believe it is an error of the editor to have it say The Inactive State as the government is active and function as of right now.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I am a citizen and know their leader and am therefore biased so i will abstain from comment.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
You should still comment. Members can consider your remarks against the conflict of interest.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
They seem suitable.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Well the political system is mostly accurate on the Microwiki page except for the Grand Unified Ministry, which has been replaced by a democratically-elected Senate with 11 seats.
There are also provincial leaders leading me to believe that Leo is built somewhat around a federal system.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Do you feel there is finally some stability in the nation? And that it will last into the distant future?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yes I do, the previous Second Republic was relatively unstable due to the leader of the foreign nation which they were formerly a part of pushing for the re-entry of Leo into his nation, but that threat is non-existent in the current state of the nation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Grand Unified Ministry
Almost feels intentional.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Ok and seeing as other members are also members of the nation in question, I look favourably on this application.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
The body is non-existent nowadays.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any further comment on Leo?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It actually wasn't.
None from I.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Neither I
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Right, let's move onto the second reading of Lurdentania.

Empire of Lurdentania</div>
The Empire of Lurdentania, also known as Lurdentania, is a self-declared sovereign state, though more commonly referred to as a micronation by external observers. Lurdentania was established on the 4th of October 2018 by Rory Mcphail, who is also its current monarch and claims land within the macronation of Australia.</div>
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
<div class="quote">Can I also urge members to vote against Lurdentania as their leader harassed me on multiple platforms, including my macronational political Facebook page and via the contact form for my role as President of the Senate of New Virginia, begging me for Adammic honourary citizenship after lying about his age on the application form.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I was literally about to post that.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Unfortunately, I have had numerous exhanges with the leader of this nation pleading for citizenship or recognition. I have also learned that other nations have had similar experiences which paints this application (for myself at least) in a poor light.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think they'd make a valuable addition to the CA but I also concur with Mr. Xia as I was about to bring that up.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that that kind of behaviour is going to be a no from me.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur with Mr.Xia.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Oh, I did not realise New Virginia had been harrassed too.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That was a statement made by Adam Belcher of Adammia.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yes and I believe Adam holds an office in New Virginia.
friendly ghost: 
Indeed.
He is the president of the senate.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Adam had only disclosed the situation with Adammia to me privately.
Either way, it reinforces the sentiment with regard to the application and I strongly believe this application should be rejected.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any more comment on this nation?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
None from me.
Aenopia will be briefly leaving this meeting however will be rejoining in about 20 minutes.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
None from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next topic is the third reading for Slobovia.

Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Reading the history from MW, it would appear they have had two ‘civil wars’ in the space of a year.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Given the drama around Slobovia's leader I am opposed to this nation entering this alliance.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Or maybe that is two in two years. Either way it is a horrible history to read.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I will be against this nations membership.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Ditto.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any further comments?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
No thank you.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let us move on to the final membership application before the addition topics of discussion.
Revalian Kingdom, first reading

Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I have a fondness for all things Estonian (lived there for a little while), but this nation is very underdeveloped. Their MW page is really poor, but I think with the right guidance could be fruitful.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I'd like to see a bit more effort to be put into the nation before admitting them to be frank.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm all for accepting nations for their potential, but I'd like to see a bit more progress before they apply.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Mr. Roscoe.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Agreed.
Agreed.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Any more before we move on?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
None from me.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Let’s carry on.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="Lord Lewis (PM of Lundenwic)#1538">@Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic</span>, you have the floor for your proposed voting changes.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Thank you.
Members, I was a little surprised to find that motions are voted on by delegate rather than a vote per nation. While I respect that this has worked in the past, it is a rather bizarre policy and makes the CA seem a little unprofessional.
Therefore I would like to know the feelings of the members about changing voting to one per nation rather than one per vote.
The current system allows for three nations with three delegates to control nine votes before another nation has been allowed to vote.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present again.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
It also implies that some nations are more important than others as they may vote more than once.
I secede the floor
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I agree with this motion - nations with 1 or 2 delegates like my own seem less important than those with the maximum number of delegates.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I have expressed my support previously for this change.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It also creates the problem of getting your mates in your nation to vote for what you want, especially if it concerns your nation.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I am grateful for the positivity. I will work with the relevant authorities to draft something to put to the honourable members here.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Wouldn't it be cede?
Otherwise you'd be making the floor an independent state
for his proposals.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe this may require a look over the charter
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
It would. I apologise, I moved to my phone and it autocorrects in a rather amusing fashion sometimes.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This is why I will work with the relevant authorities.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This is something that has been discussed before, however I feel like we could do with retouching on the idea of how we're going to choose the next cabinet seeing as my administration is beginning in the next month.
I have previously stated before that I am in support of elections for cabinet seats however I feel that there are pros and cons to both appointment and elections so I thought I would bring it up here.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The floor is Logan's right now, please let Logan speak without interference to those who are typing.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that either system of appointment works however I thought I'd bring it up to allow for other delegates to have their say in how the next cabinet will be decided.
I open the floor for discussion.
James B. - Desert District: 
I believe a system of appointment and confirmation by Parliament is best.
If appointments were to happen without confirmation, we could get individuals who don’t truly represent the views of the Alliance’s members.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I personally have no preference. I do not believe you will make poor decisions in your appointments as this would reflect badly on yourself. However, I fully appreciate the democratic vote.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that allowing people to run for positions means that we are open to a more diverse cabinet and allows for people to grow however appointment means that we can choose those who we believe are best for the job and saves time and effort.
James B. - Desert District: 
If we have full on elections, a Minister who does not work with the Chair role can be selected.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">If appointments were to happen without confirmation, we could get individuals who don’t truly represent the views of the Alliance’s members.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
Oh I see.
As I was saying,
if a Cabinet cannot work efficiently with the Chair the Alliance will crumble.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Good point.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This is a very good point that I had failed to note.
James B. - Desert District: 
It isn’t even much of a “Cabinet” anymore.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe the system of public nomination would be opportune.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
However I believe that if the minister cannot work with the chair then they shouldn't run at all.
<div class="quote">By public self-nomination, and voting, we will open the pool for fresh eyes and fresh talent, acquiring the best man for the job.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
And some members may not self-nominate.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
What do you mean?
By only some members can't self-nominate. Does that mean others can.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Some people may not volunteer to run themselves.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I would never think of putting myself forward for anything.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
On the other hand I do support appointment as well seeing as I've already created my cabinet plan so it would seem like a bit of a waste of time otherwise.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Really? I could see you doing well in the CA.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I’ve never really thought of myself as good enough.
This could be true of other members too and some will need that nudge and self belief.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You can still release it, and it can take effect whether its appointment or confirmation.
James B. - Desert District: 
If the nominee really doesn’t represent the views of the members, they’ll get voted down and the Chair will have to nominate someone else.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I’ve never really thought of myself as good enough.
James B. - Desert District: 
It is the only way to ensure the Alliance’s wishes are represented and that the Chair is able to work efficiently with the nominee.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I would prefer this.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Perhaps it may be wise to put this to vote, allowing the alliance itself to decide whether it would prefer appointments, chair nominations or public nominations?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">If the nominee really doesn’t represent the views of the members, they’ll get voted down and the Chair will have to nominate someone else.
<div class="quote">Perhaps it may be wise to put this to vote, allowing the alliance itself to decide whether it would prefer appointments, chair nominations or public nominations?
As I can no longer attend the rest of this session I will save the rest of my proposals until next session.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted. Thank you for your proposals.
Does any delegate wish to come forward with any other proposals?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Aye.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Mr. Valentinus, you have the floor.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to propose the formation of a preliminary Charter Commission.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I would be in support of a Charter Commission.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I wholeheartedly agree!
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Does anybody wish to elaborate or have any other comments?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I think there has been rather a lot of discussion about this in other channels. The consensus appears to be in favour.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted.
If there is no more comment or proposals for the Parliament, I see fit that the 54th session be adjourned at 6:40PM UTC.

Nice logo.

Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Atiera intermittently present.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
The Kingdom of Humberlea is present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Alas, let us proceed.
The first item on the agenda is Transitioning to the Ross administration.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Only a congratulations.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I concur
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur as well
Soaring - Regelis: 
I concur.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
it's not up to us to do much, the transition is up to the involved parties
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Indeed.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Shall we then proceed?
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
aye
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Yes.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Certainly.
Soaring - Regelis: 
Yes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Then let us discuss the updated draft for the proposed Cupertino News Agency.
News standard draft 2</div>
Mission With the rise of misinformation and diminished quality news content, it is vital that a news standard shall be created and rewards towards fulfilling this news standard shall also be created to incentivise the following and enforcement of these standards.   Editorial Guidelines   Commun...</div>
Warmedic - Monmark: 
May I make comment to certain sections?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Aye, you may.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
With regard to fact checking, how can we be sure it will be conducted impartially?
I understand there will be citing of sources and other such things, but perhaps only to me, that would appear inadequate in preventing a bias from forming.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I don't think a bias is really a problem. as long as the channel doesn't spread lies or pass unconfirmed rumours as truths, there's no real problem. if people think the channel is too right wing, just make a more left wing channel.
there has to be a balance between freedom and scrutiny
we can't collymoddle everything
Warmedic - Monmark: 
But we must ensure objective reporting.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I agree that is it very easy to see news slant either one way or the other. News should be determinable by a reader to contain facts, and no other information.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
That cannot be argued against.
Indeed, but the matter I am discussing is how we ensure this.
Sir Tom's proposal is not too bad, but I feel that it is in some manner weak.
Soaring - Regelis: 
You can read it to ensure that it is not. Those who violate the mandate can be penalized.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
yeah
Soaring - Regelis: 
It is fairly easy to determine biased reporting. There would just need to be someone to intercept the news agency that is offending the rules.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I think that bias should be acceptable, slander should not be. I'm sure that a middle ground could be reached in there
Warmedic - Monmark: 
The issue is the fact that people like sweet apples, and sour apples, and they take news like anything else.
Well that's a neat little transition.
In the same clause, it talks of Libel, but as to where we can draw that line is another thing.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Intermintently.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
By bias do you mean the taking of the context towards one story rather then the analytical story?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
If I may use an example, on January 6th, when President Trump refused Maryland's State Militia, what can the News organisation say?
Soaring - Regelis: 
The dictator and chief made the ghastly decision to...
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
The least useful form of reporting, perhaps even damaging, is one that creates a false equivalency.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Warmedic - Monmark: 
And my concern, is the clamping down on free, accurate speech.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
it's libel when it's published, can potentially hurt someone's reputation, and is false. in the case of a court case regarding libel, the publishing party has to present concrete evidence that the statements were 100% true. especially that last bit can be changed in the name of free speech, but that's the basics
Warmedic - Monmark: 
So would this be allowed?
Soaring - Regelis: 
Ideally no.
The point is to all the free, accurate speech and opinion delivery process, without clear news network-wide bias that is easily detectable by any viewer.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Would saucy sarcasm be available in an Op-Ed and/or Factual Report?
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
the term dictator is potentially harmful to their image, and it's false. it's still a democratic system. so technically, yes. but, like I said, some things can be amended
Soaring - Regelis: 
It would have to be clearly labelled as an opinion piece and not representative of the views of the news agency or its affiliates etc...
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
it's a balancing act
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Yet we all know what <strong>America</strong> is and their system; this to me is simply an attack on free sarcasm.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
you either clamp down on the press to ensure neutrality, or you allow free speech and bias.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
That's what I've been hammering at.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
you can't get both perfectly, you have to find a balance
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Neutrality.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I'm not saying you can't have an opinion, I am just saying that a news agency's opinion should effect Cupertino's image, especially if we are endorsing them with a special badge and the like.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
There cannot be neutrality when on January sixth, a mob or deranged and ill people raided the capital.
LamentTwice: 
Nova Tromso is present
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
We cannot show both sides of every single argument, in some instances there is simply an undeniable truth.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Very rarely is there a undeniable truth.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
In more instances than you think.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
well, this is libel. just say that a mob of trump supporters stormed the capitol. neutral statement, fully factional, and not harmful to the image of the mob
Warmedic - Monmark: 
A armed coup?
James B. - Desert District: 
Uh is the host here?
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
there's never a need to refer to mental illness unless it is absolutely true
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
also acceptable
James B. - Desert District: 
These seems to be going off topic and he’s not been here in quite some minutes.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="Indo-Malaysia#1882">@Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville</span>
You there?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Where do we draw the line is what I have been referring to.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I disagree. we're on topic, we're debating a potential amendment.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I only wish to see some sort of clause ensuring free speech is not being clamped down.
Soaring - Regelis: 

James B. - Desert District: 
Well I’m still wondering.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That's not far from libel.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am here indeed.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
Ok then.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
They are discussing an aspect of the revised draft relating to neutrality of certified articles.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Unless you can prove that most people at that riot were deranged and ill.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
<div class="quote">On Jan 6th a radicalised terrorist organisation spearheaded by president Donald Trump calling for an attack on democracy?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
How do we know they are a terrorist organization?
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I say we draw the line at public statements that are harmful to the image of the subject, that can not be proven to be true. this means that you refer to a mob of trump supporters (you can prove this, because flags and everything), and not to radicalised mentally ill people.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
exactly
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
And how do we know Trump leads it.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I remind all we are half an hour into the session.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
They carried arms, and damaged property, and lead to the deaths of five people.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
In the interest of timekeeping, may we wrap this discussion up?
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
the republican party would win in a lawsuit
I concur
Soaring - Regelis: 
No, because you need to fact check the following things.
========================
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
let's put this debate on hold, and move it to the end, so we can work on the other points of the agenda first
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
This is a great example of what to do.
Soaring - Regelis: 
Fair, I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur, let's move on.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I intend to move to the next item on the agenda.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
The line must be drawn fairly and protect objectivity and free speech, and to that end we must devote all our efforts.
That is my final statement on the matter.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We shall now discuss the <strong>Planned Agreements for Summits, Trade and Agreements Act.</strong>
PASTA Act</div>

Soaring - Regelis: 
First impression is that the name is kind of immature, but alright.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I have two procedural comments.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That was the issue we had with it last time.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I do not think it immature, I think it's a great acronym which makes it much easier to refer to and remember
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I think the name is a very minor issue.
Soaring - Regelis: 
Sections 6 and 7 are incomplete.
Is the purpose of this to pair members as trade partners by proximity?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe the issue of the bills incomplete status has been brought to the parliaments attention on many occasions. To my knowledge, this is still yet to be rectified.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
during the last meeting, the bill was still a draft
it probably is still being written
Warmedic - Monmark: 
We cannot pass a bill that is incomplete; would it not have been better to provide the bill for criticism and then finish it, only to then present it to this assembly?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
To clarify, this is a mere discussion rather than an official reading.
cameron: 
Australis no longer present
Soaring - Regelis: 
My issue is that action can be taken on international trade within our organization, without this bill.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I therefore retract my previous statement.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
it's just a checkup on what's already there
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
would you mind clarifying this statement?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
To clarify, redundency?
Soaring - Regelis: 
The bill appoints positions and officers, for the oversight of summits related to trade. I am talking about the fundamental need for the trade summits in general. Couldn't trade occurring between nations be recordkept by those nations?
I just am missing the vision for what this bill is trying to achieve.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
You seek to keep trade decentralised?
Soaring - Regelis: 
Why are we trying to centralize trade permissions? The ability to trade with other micronations, and the contents of those trades I feel does not need to be overseen by a micronational organization. Even if the two doing trading are members of that organization.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
by centralising these things, unethical practices and crimes can more easily be spotted and dealt with
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is it our place to intervene to such an extent?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I highly doubt there will be crimes or unethical practices.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Mr. Soaring, would you prefer a trade court system, where violations can be reported?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
And we have a supreme judge for a reason.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
yes, but I also highly doubted a fascist would rise to power in America. it's just better to be prepared.
not everything goes as expected, after all
Warmedic - Monmark: 
We must additionally think of how new members will view this.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't really think they want there jurisdiction on trade taken away.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur
Soaring - Regelis: 
A court system for trade related crime makes more sense than creating yet another committee within CA overseeing trade for the infrequent occurrence the a micronation will trade illicit goods and services. Like they would even have that information in their recordkeeping if they were.
<div class="quote">It says here in your ledger you traded 20 troy oz of silver for 1 oz of cocane.</div>
Who would even do that?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Regardless of my own political opinions, I must agree with the Member from Regelis.
I do not see how this will be too productive, we have some in favour and some against, and it seems that the vote will decide this once it comes to it.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is the scale of micronational trade amongst member states high enough to warrant the need for any such regulations or bodies?
Soaring - Regelis: 
That was going to my next point.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Even if it was, I believe the court systems would be best for such disputes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Overall this just seems like an unnecessary and hastily put together bill.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Forsooth.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We have enough inactive bills already, let's not create more.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Hear, hear.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Shall we move on?
Soaring - Regelis: 
Yes.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I ask the host, if we could move onto the next item.
Yes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

Soaring - Regelis: 
I have no problems with this bill whatsoever.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
No objections here.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
None from me.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
no objections here
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Next item on the agenda?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Our next item on the agenda should be regarding the nomination of the Associate Judge. As the vote has concluded and the nominee confirmed, I am opting to skip this item.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I'm in favour of that
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Hear Hear.
Soaring - Regelis: 
Same.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Our final item of discussion prior to applications is related to our Ecological programs.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I have nothing to add to this subject.
Soaring - Regelis: 
I concur.
Is the plan here to stockpile and distribute seeds?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I see. Do any other delegates have comments on this item?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I concur as well
LamentTwice: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I see.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Too many concurrences, it hurts.
Not at all.
Tom Haex | West Sayville: 
I do not
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

I'd recommend at least waiting with them. they're still working on their judicial system (well, I was, I don't think any progress is going on there anymore), and they're generally just still busy with building themselves up.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
What, most recently won an election on 1 February 2020.?
Tom Haex | West Sayville:

they're back

Soaring - Regelis: 
I have no issues with Leo, we have had a prior favorable relationship with them, albeit unofficial.

Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nothing to add.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark is Present briefly.
I wholeheartedly oppose this nation, as they are basically rebranded Luchijan.
Soaring - Regelis: 
This nation existed prior to Luchijan though.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
The leader is the same.
I recuse myself on the vote.
Soaring - Regelis: 
Oh it seems they also negotiate with Tinakula at some capacity. So there might be crossbreeding there.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I am the Head of State for the NeoUK, the nation who acquired Luchijan, and I feel I should not corrupt Maple's vote. I will refer to Maple leadership and vote accordingly.

If anybody wishes to state anything before we begin take the time to do so now.
cameron: 
Over the last few days, I applied a case to be heard regarding the suspension of Nicholas Fisher. For unknown reasons, the Superior Court has failed to get back to me regarding the case. For more details; I legally presented a case regarding the suspension of Nicholas Fisher to the Superior Court. In my findings, I have concluded that not only did the Superior Judge break the charter regarding the decision to suspend Fisher, the Judge also declined to hold the case; when asked for a reason why, simply put Stop DMing me.. This is a blatant disregard and dissapointing from the man/system who is supposed to serve the case that was applied to the highest court in this organization. To have not only the evidence regarding the suspension of Fisher written off like most investigations (Dhrub and others), but the whole case I presented against them also ignored is a clear deflection of the court's duties and powers granted per the charter. I will, and will always stand by my idea that the man I applied to defend is innocent.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
may I have the floor?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Delegates of the Alliance.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you for your concerns about the Acting Superior Judge, we shall host a full discussion about this later in today's session.
Otherwise let's begin.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
May I speak on the matter on behalf of Daniel Roscoe?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We shall begin with discussing the transition over to a Ross Administration in just under 1 month time.
<div class="quote">May I speak on the matter on behalf of Daniel Roscoe?
friendly ghost: 
I for one am excited to hear about the transition, Mr. Ross.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Very well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I can confirm that I have a plan regarding the Cabinet which I will be finalising with Mr. Xia and other work is underway to bring a smooth transition when Mr. Lycon steps down on the 15th.
Does anybody wish to state anything or bring anything up about this transition?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Nope.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
A question Mr (Lieutenant) Chair?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is Present
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
In your statement you mention a cabinet plan. What can you tell us about this plan, and does it outline whether the cabinet will be filled by either appointment or public nomination?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I can confirm that most of the current standing Ministers will likely be staying in their positions whilst most of the seats (except for the planned Head of Graphics + Treasury) will be staying pretty much the same.
For while it doesn't currently outline the means of deciding said cabinet as of now, I hope to push forward with my plan of appointment.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
You mention a Head of Graphics. Is the CESE not a dependent agency, as opposed to a division itself of the alliance?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The idea of a Head Of Graphics is more for a specific person to handle the designing of graphics and would likely work with the CESE if the Head of Graphics becomes a formal ministry.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Will the office take up the neglected North Lincolnshire programme?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes.
I do hope to revitalise the North Lincolnshire project as well.
Shall we move on then?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Moving on then, we have the 3rd and final reading of the News standard draft. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qzZztOUe1L5g5GlIbp5kkWWO9sY0DG36gkbclcWul34/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qzZztOUe1L5g5GlIbp5kkWWO9sY0DG36gkbclcWul34/edit</a>

I am fully in support of this as for too long has our news outlet been inactive.
By revitalising it to focus on both the CA and its member states it could serve as a good source for unbiased professional news.
Anybody wish to speak on this?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
“News organizations shall not publish any stub articles, articles which do not present or contribute facts or opinions to a given topic, or condone any forms of illegal actions.“ May I ask what exactly does illegal action mean?
Because law may vary from country to country
Rory - Lurdentania: 
One question Mr Lieutenant Chair, is the purpose of this to control Micronational News Organisations or simply control a CA sponsored one?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I presume it will be macronational laws.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The News Standard makes no mention of either the Gazette or the Nacre service.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
My apologies.
<div class="quote">One question mr Lieutenant Chair, is the purpose of this to control Micronational News Organisations or simply control a CA sponsored one?
Anybody else wish to state anything about this
Rory - Lurdentania: 
No.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Let us move on then.
Next up we have the establishment of dedicated sessions for memberships.
From what I can deduce from this, I believe this is sessions dedicated to applicant nations to get a taste of CA meetings like open days at work places or schools.
Anybody wish to state anything regarding this?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I have the floor?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
May I have the Floor after the Delegate for Pinelandia.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
After the Delegate for Pinelandia yes.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Noted.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The concept of the Membership Sessions was to discuss membership applications wholly in a separate session entirely, &#225; la the Grand Unified Micronational.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
The delegate of Lurdentainia next.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I personally believe this is a good idea, because personally I was only accepted a while ago and I am rather clueless concerning how things “work”. On top of the Delegate for Pinelandia’s statement, it could be run by a volunteered minister.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe like me you have mistaken this motion.
This is for discussing membership applications.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes. But isn’t it a session for membership applicants to attend?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is here for some time
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Not exactly, it was intended just to discuss membership applications, though that idea can be adapted into these sessions
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Ah I understand better now. Thanks you Mr Lycon.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that instead of creating more sessions we should keep membership applications in the current 3 meetings.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
It that case I would not support the motion.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If you create more meetings then people are going to feel less motivated to attend meetings so we'll see a dip in activity in my opinion.
Shall we move on then?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Next up we have the Associate Judges nominations.
I believe that Brennan Sullivan would make an excellent Associate Judge.
The floor is open to discussion.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Point of Order.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Sullivan has already been elected as Associate Judge, as per <span class="mention">#voting-hall</span>
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This period is moreso discussing about the recent appointment
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What made you so keen to propose Sullivan as an Associate Judge?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Sullivan is already an Associate Judge however I believe that he is a fairly active and professional individual who will serve the position well.
cameron: 
Point of Order.
Sullivan was already elected as an Associate Judge. Why are we holding discussion over this if the vote concluded already?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
cameron: 
I agree with this statement, but I think there doesn't need to be discussion regarding this if we already elected said offical
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Fair.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
A discussion was presented just in case any delegate posed any objections that they faced. But fair point nevertheless.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
May we move on?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I nor Ross did not appoint him, the Superior Judge nominated with Parliament's approval
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We shall move on then.
Next up we have the discussion of trusted retail stores for the GreenCities project.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
May I have the floor?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I believe the Trusted Retail stores would need to be split into the continents we have members in. For example I doubt members are going to fly to Australia to buy seeds from Bunnings etc.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The seeds are ordered online from regional stores.
<a href="https://www.rareseeds.com/">https://www.rareseeds.com/</a>
Seeds from 59p - Grow The BEST Veg and Flowers from Seeds</div>
Buy garden seeds in the UK online from 59p. Wide range of heirloom and traditional varieties. Best Quality Seeds &amp; Cheapest Online. Guaranteed Germination.</div>
The Seed Collection: Buy herb, flower and vegetable seeds online.</div>
Herb, vegetable and flower seeds. Heirloom, open pollinated, non hybrid and non GMO seeds with no chemical treatments.</div>
If anybody has any experience with the following 3 stores then please let us know.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
But overseas shipping in Australia is currently not so heavily supported, which is another concern. Do these websites operate in Australia too?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Last website does.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Again these are regional stores.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Then I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unless anybody wishes to state anything else we shall move on.
Next up we have the renewal of the Charter.
The current charter, for which has served us well, is outdated and does not reflect our needs as an Alliance. As we are constantly growing and changing, we need to renew the Charter to better suit our present and future.
This is currently scheduled for sometime during my term.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I have the floor briefly to echo my statement from the last session?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What changes do you propose? Briefly.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Noted.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Last session I proposed a charter commission to review the charter, so that we have a strong launch point for the convention in Ross's term.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur with the points you have brought up and your nominations.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Who would appoint members to said committee?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Likely myself once I enter office or Mr. Lycon.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Assumed so.
One more question, if this committee were to draft a new charter, would they be able to implement it straight away, or would it undergo voting?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yes I believe so
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It would undergo voting first.
The individual articles would be voted on by the committee whilst the full charter would be vote don by Parliament once finished.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
But how would you assume a two person committee could represent the whole alliance?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It would be more than 2 members.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The committee will have several members. I merely recommended two highly skilled individuals, to clarify.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Got it
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Shall we move on then?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes
cameron: 
Point of order?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
cameron: 
Oh, I do apologize, my questions have been answered
Disregard
Rory - Lurdentania: 
May we move on Mr. Lt Chairman
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes.
Next up we have membership applications.

Firstly they state they have a population of 7, but have a parliament with 13 seats
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Didn't we reject them 2 weeks ago?

Anybody wish to add anything else before we wrap up for tonight?

Regarding my vote of no confidence?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Concerning this, who is incumbent to the position?

Rory - Lurdentania: 
Then I believe action should be taken.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I would also like to speak, myself on this matter. I find it incredibly sad that members and an associate judge must criticize their fellow delegates to the point of where a vote of no confidence must be incited. Additionally, I agree with Daniel, Cameron and Sertor in the fact that Jamez had not been impartial. Thus, I will be supporting this motion of no confidence.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Yeah, this seems as if it's a shaky situation in general.
cameron: 
All I am trying to do is to protect the democratic structure this alliance was founded upon.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything else before we wrap up for tonight?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Amici sees this as a clear failure to uphold the law and a false dismissal of the case.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It is in the title of the document.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Ah I see
cameron: 
The Superior Court failed to acknowledge, or even hold the case. They also did not make any requests for me or Fisher to file out the form for a case per Article 71 of the Charter; again I feel was a clear deflection of their duties
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania will no longer be present
cameron: 
I feel for this alliance to have a good legal structure, the current inhabitant of this office must be removed swiftly
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
These accusations are concerning.
May I ask in what manner did the Superior Judge unlawfully dismiss the case?
cameron: 
When Fisher inquired why the Judge didn't hear the case, the Judge simply said I'm not interested in being questioned. and Stop DMing me.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I see.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Any further comments?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
No
cameron: 
When will the vote be held? I'm genuinely concerned with the inhabitant getting to stay in their position.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
That seems inappropriate.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Mr. Valentinus will be setting up the poll post-session.
cameron: 
I understand. Nothing else, then

Right, let's get started. Hopefully the members present will pick up as the session progesses.
First up on our agenda is the establishment of dedicated sessions for membership applications.
I, for one, am highly against this idea. We already have many sessions often occurring, and adding more will over saturate it.

I concur.
Further sessions would require further time dedication and further need for organisation
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This, which not a lot of people can dedicate enough time to attend tons of sessions a month.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
And consider we all do live a life, this would make it extremely difficult for us to “Enjoy the CA”
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What do you mean by that
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Basically what you said
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Ah got it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We have a life meaning we're not always available for lots of sessions
Rory - Lurdentania: 
May I ask a question?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If it is related to this topic, yes.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes.
Never mind.
I just realised we answered it last session.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted
Moving on, we have the greencities revival.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<span class="mention">#green-cities-introduction</span>, take your time to have a look at these and report back what you think of the changes that have taken place
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Correct me if I am wrong, but would the CA order the Plants for the applying individuals?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe so.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
And how much funds have been allocated to this and where have these funds come from?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Unsure on the former, but the answer to the latter is Lycon's bank account.
I am quite concerned as to how this is going to progress into the Ross administration.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
That was going to be my next comment.
Would this mean that Chairman-Elect Ross would have to pay for this event?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Unsure yet again, you'll have to ask them.
Any more questions on this topic?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
One more
Could the Alliance possible organise and run a fundraiser to fundraiser this topic, if Mr Ross wishes not to personally fund it as the new Chairman?
In the event that Ross is left the responsibility of doing so.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Fundraising for making money for the Alliance is a bit eh
if there were to be a fundraiser it should be for charity.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I suppose I concur
No further questions
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Ok
Moving on, we have the changes to the Ministry of Membership Attainment

This will be beneficial for discussing members outside the public session channel, for privacy during discussions about member states.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
None of those Chanel’s seem to appear for me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Probably only see them when you're a full member.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What do you mean by this, and due to my lack of access could you further explain this topic?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Membership applications and votes are better off being away from the public eye, due to the increased amount of scrutiny etc
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I agree
Personally (and I must admit this was me) I would watch membership sessions and see how  Lurdentania was going, and then approve the Problems and find out solutions to stated issues, which i look back now and suppose was wrong. I believe they should be judged off on the same basis as when applicants first apply
Otherwise each session you would be judging different material.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I see.
Any more discussion on this topic?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
None
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright
We now have the proposed revival of the Cupertino Reference Centre

I believe this was an important feature of the CA which needs updating for everyone to access resources.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
Is this a privilege for everyone or specifically members
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Everyone I believe.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Hm.
Would the results of elections and voting be shown here?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think everything related to the CA will be.
Any more discussion on this matter?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
None
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let's move on then
To a rather important topic, the Charter.
More specificially, improvements, or a possible replacement Charter.
The Charter, in my eyes, supported the fledgling Alliance, but now that we have grown it has been necessary to write a new one.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
In the event we were to adapt a new charter, would I occur during the Ross-Xia Administration?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes
A standing commission has also been established.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention">#charter-discussion</span>
Rory - Lurdentania:

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
And who will choose the members of this committee

People volunteer
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Hm, alright.
I have nothing further to add.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
No

Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
I must point out that they say they have 13 seats in the Parliament, but it appears on 6 are filled
And 7 in the upper house
Of which 5 are filled
13+7 = 20 and they state they have 19 citizens. There government proportions do not seem well thought out nor do they seem sensible

Alright, let's get started
The first topic would be the transitioning to the Ross administration. The Government will be open to hearing its feedback regarding the transition and will use this period to answer any questions regarding the transition.
The floor is open.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The Cabinet should be nominated and voted on prior to Ross becoming incumbent.
So as to prevent delays
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I would also like to note per our campaign manifesto that I will be leaving my position as the Minister of Agreements, Development, and Projects once I am made Lt. Chair
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Any final comments before we move on?
Alright then let's move on
Sebolivier: 
Georgienstine is present
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Next topic would be the establishment of dedicated sessions for membership applications. These sessions would only read membership applications, but allows us to invite applicants to speak in these sessions in the future. I open the floor.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Would we need to do 3 sessions for every time zone?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
There are numerous sessions already, I do not think there is a need to create more.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
If this plan is approved then we'll probably do 2 sessions with some parts of Asia and Oceania being merged
Marka Mejakhansk: 
The system as it currently exists seems to work pretty efficiently
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Any final comments before we move on?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
None from Australis, other than that I concur with the previous statements.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Otherwise let's move on
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">The next topic on the list is the  GreenCities revival. Information regarding this revival can be seen at <span class="mention">#green-cities-introduction</span>. The Government wishes for delegate's...

I cede the floor.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
It’s a great idea. Just from the point of view of privacy and security, where addresses are given to organise the delivery, it’s important that those addresses are deleted after their use. There shouldn’t be any compilation of the information even to allow for future similar projects.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thank you, just to re-affirm the Government will not share personal information, and will delete any information from our end after it has finished being used for the GreenCities order.
Marka Mejakhansk: 
Very good. Other than that it’s a really innovative idea, and the method of getting the seeds out is well thought out.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This was our concern too and is why we will not put ourselves forward to supply seeds for the UK.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted, the suppliers we have chose are trusted retail stores that are economical to allow more nations to use this program.

Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Could we move on?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Government plans for the first issue of the Capstone Tribune to be on early February. The Capstone Tribune being the complication of news articles around various member nations to make one large newspaper, allowing for more viewership. The Government is looking for interested authors or organizations for this program, as well as general feedback regarding the idea.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
as Prime Minister of Australis
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Fantastic
Marka Mejakhansk: 
Does the Tribune require articles to be written specifically for it, or can it be re-publishing of other articles? For example if an article appears in the Nemkhav Federal News can it also be submitted to the tribune?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
The Xijing Morning Post, Yu-Xia’s official news agency, shall be contributing a news article on a recent bill passed by the National Assembly
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Re-publishing is allowed.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I think you mean compilation, but I think we could contribute if needed. Would the tribune be interested in interviews?
Marka Mejakhansk: 
Ok, cool. In that case I’m quite sure the Nemkhav Federal News will contribute - I just can’t say for sure what that contribution will be for now.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Compilation was the word I meant to say, apologizes for the mistake. The tribune would be interested in interviews.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Perfect! Is there a certain deadline to work to or is this a preliminary call for authors?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Just a preliminary call for now.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Thank you.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Alas, 'tis fair to proceed.

Good question, maybe in Spring but it all depends on our macronational government's handling of the coronavirus pandemic
I suppose in the summer since basically everything is cancelled

There are plans to revive the said program, but we have not begun to work on a revival of the Earth Day Clean-Up Event.

No comment from me.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Alright then, let’s move onto the next item.
The floor is now open to Ministry of Membership Attainment service improvements and suggestions.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Oh?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I am not entirely sure myself.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I can't really comment on this matter, as I do not really know how this ministry operates.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Ministry wants to hear from delegates regarding improvements that can be made / are made regarding the process

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Noted.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Fair enough then.
Back on with the Cupertino Reference Centre, I'd support the idea if it was simply a catalogue of important and notable documents.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I support the revival of the CRC too.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The document seems to hint at a museum-of sorts, which I don't really see the point in.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Perhaps it could list items of interest and the micronation they are located in
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
On the topic of the CRC, if wished, I could collate and set up one on either MicroWiki or MicroCommons, should it be wished. 
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Considering the increased reputation of the alliance that could happen
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd support hosting it over MicroCommons.
Anybody wish to add anything before we move on?
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
No for the moment. I'm still support the CRC, and about hosting, in MicroCommons.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Moving onto the applications.
We shall begin with the Kingdom of the Iceni.
Kingdom of the Iceni
Kingdom of the Iceni</div>
Iceni, officially the Kingdom of the Iceni or Iceni Kingdom is a micronation that was created on the 26th September 2019 by John Gordon. The government is a unitary semi-constitutional monarchy in which the monarch holds executive power, The legislature is the Iceni Landtag</div>

The floor is open.
They are a member of the GUM, however my main concern is that they seem to metamorphosis a lot.
Since they were accepted as a GUM member they have already changed name and flag which brings up stability concerns.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am familiar with Mr Gordon from the New Virginian National Party. They have a rather expansive portfolio, I believe even serving as the Prime Minister of Austenasia right as we speak.
I believe they will be an excellent addition to our team.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I know Mr. Gordon personally having met on several occasions. He and his nation would only serve as an asset to this organisation. Slowly but surely I am persuading nations to join here.
Woland - Desert District: 
I disagree with the assertion that a name or flag change constitutes a stability concern.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I would support Iceni's entry into this organization.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
They sound extremely professional.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would support them as I have no doubts that they are a good candidate for membership.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
In my opinion, I would support Iceni's membership, but as an observer. Then it will be evaluated later to grant him the membership.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Observership is automatic as per the Membership Reorganisation Act.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Doesn’t every nation have to go through observership?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I support Iceni’s application.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything else?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I believe so
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Incredibly sad. This session has been at a standstill for about 7 minutes.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Yeah.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
No responses from Xia or Ross
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
In Mr. Ross's absence, I will move on to the next topic on the agenda.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Okay.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Sorry for the wait, I presume Mr. Ross yet again has connection issues and I myself was busy with something else.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Took you long enough.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Wifi's back again.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Please note that I have commitments and needs outside of micronationalism Mr. Munroe.

Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Mr Munroe, please be kinder to other delegates.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
There was nothing rude about what I’ve said. My point is, how can we trust an administration who lets the sessions just stop for 7 minutes. At this rate, Atiera alongside many other nations are going to leave.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Can we proceed in an orderly fashion?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I do apologise that my internet is poor.

Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
They seem very new.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I can't seem to find a MW page...
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Seems like it’s gonna be a no from me.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Do you not understand that Mr. Ross has issues for attendance outside of his control and I have commitments outside of micronationalism? I was informed on a short notice to substitute if Mr. Ross's internet were to go down, which it has multiple times. Is that hard to comprehend?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Can we please be respectful and return to the topic at hand?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
This conversation is over, Mr. Xia. Stop causing a scene and continue with the session.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Again we shall move on.
I'm not asking anymore.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Please continue this debate elsewhere.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
On the topic at hand, they do seem rather young as Mr. Sullivan has pointed out.
Probably going to be a no from me.
Anybody have anything else they wish to add?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
No.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I do believe the nation is underdeveloped and quite young, I will be voting no on this application.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I encourage them to return when they are more developed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
The nation is still young for the moment.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
On the other side of the coin, would they perhaps benefit from our development projects, should it be evidenced the leaders are properly committed to their nation?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
At least get a constitution, and some more citizens.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Exactly.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
There doesn't seem to be much of an attempt at development or effort on their part, which is why I am against their application at the moment.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
May we proceed?
cameron: 
No.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I see. I will take my leave then.
Woland - Desert District: 
I concur.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
We can proceed, again sorry for the delay.
Are there any final proposals before we adjourn this session?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I was just about to say I was going to motion to close quorum in 6 minutes, but alas it is not necessary.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We do have an application from Bushistan however it depends on whether everyone else wishes to do it today or postpone.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
An appointment?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Do you mean application?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Autocorrect.
Fixed now.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yes I do believe it is appropriate to review the application today to not keep the nation waiting.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Republic of Bushistan
Bushistan</div>
The Republic of Bushistan, or simply referred to as Bushistan, is a small micronation with scattered land across the southern states of Alabama and Mississippi. The mainland is located in Alabama, home to its capital, Bush City. The country has various attractions, including a museum, a memorial park, a space center with tours, a multipurpose sp...</div>

Thus we decree that The Republic of Bushistan shall be a free and independent nation. This document shall go...</div>
Their MW page isn't terrible for a young state and they have recently applied for GUM member status.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Same as the previous nation. It's still a young and underdeveloped state.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their interactions on the GUM server has led me to believe that they are a good candidate despite their age.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe they would be suitable for observership and we can re-evaluate in two weeks as per the standard membership procedure.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd be willing to give them Observership to see how they fare.
<div class="quote">I believe they would be suitable for observership and we can re-evaluate in two weeks as per the regular membership procedure.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As a note, it is literally impossible to give anything other than observer at this point in the application process.

Noted.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Any further discussion before we close for tonight?

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm just going to allow us to get started quickly, there's really not a lot on tonight's agenda. Just a couple of discussions and two application readings.
<strong>Discussion: Evolution of the GreenCities project towards the Cupertino Grant Fund for space projects</strong>
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Personally, I have no strong opinions on the matter, although I’m sure my fellow Atieran delegates will disagree with me here. 
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I am personally not sure on the thought of grants, per se, but I think the idea of incorporating micronational rocketry and aerospace programs into the CA is a good idea.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think it could be instead possible to partner with organisations such as the IAC, if they also wish to.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
In regard to the motion, I'm going to oppose it based on the fact that as I said, we shouldn't be turning the CA into a micronational shop and instead focus on our current projects.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If a nation wants to start a space agency then they should join some of the groups such as the IAC that specialise in this kind of stuff.
friendly ghost: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Thank you for your comments.
Is there any other discussion on this matter?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
None from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe we should move on to our next topic of discussion, then.
Which is CuperChats. 
I think that this would be an interesting topic to pursue but the next administration should first focus on bolstering current programs and ensuring their revival.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think this would be an awesome idea if the Alliance has the resources to pull it off. It could bring some wider intermicronational attention to the Alliance.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We should stop with the creation of these projects for now until our next administration can settle and do the work we need to.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur. I'm looking forward to seeing the work you can put into reviving these programs, Mr. Ross.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you - I'm going to start drawing up a cause of action this evening for the programs.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Good good.
Will there be any further discussion pertaining to this matter?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing more from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
None from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We shall now move on.
Next up is the Noted Project Update. I don't have any documentation for this, but I assume this refers to the fact that the Noted Project letter has successfully arrived at Tesforia on Long Island.
Noted Project</div>
The Noted! Project, also known as the Noted Project, Noted Tour or Noted Programme is a diplomatic tour within the Cupertino Alliance organised by Chairman Jayden Lycon.</div>
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I personally have nothing to say on the matter.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As above.
All I can do is commend the current work that has gone into getting it this far.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree. Luckily it has not gone lost like Diplomabear.
I wish to receive this letter eventually.
Any more discussion regarding the Noted Project?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Moving on, then.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The Constitution is quite poor.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Welcome back.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They don't seem to have a MicroWiki page by the looks of things.
Not a very good start...
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Furthermore, it meets almost none of the requirements in the Remarks.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If a nation does not meet the requirements in remarks, then shouldn't we executively reject them?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I oppose this nation. Their leader is JLMJXD, someone who was fairly active in Galtean politics before we became a colony of Atiera. 
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Oh yeah. The Chair can do that as he doesn't fit the age requirements.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Time is precious and if a nation cannot adhere to the requirements then they shouldn't be worth out rime in my opinion.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Just noting down here a possible executive rejection for this nation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">The Chair can do that as he doesn't fit the age requirements.

I would like to say I will be supporting Iceni's application.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their leader and nation seem professional.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur, and will also be supporting their application.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Absolutely. Their leader is an outstanding individual!
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
They're professional (didn't John Gordon serve as the PM of Austenasia?) and everything looks good.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
To my knowledge, they still are.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Yes, he is still in office.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Ah, duly noted.

Nothing from me.

Then I see that this session shall be adjourned at 15:40 (UTC), provided nobody wishes to take the floor for another matter.

I must commend the speaker for the fast meeting this afternoon - it simply proves that we don't need long sessions to work productively.

The floor is open.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
This message from the honorable delegate for Australis sums up my feelings on the matter well.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Tesforia is semi-present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think it's a fine idea but It will be considerably more pricy than the GreenCities project
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Maybe but the problem could lie to what materials each space agency uses
Since CONSPACT (If I am correct) uses materials that have been identified by the Canadian government to be a bit dangerious
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
It’s very interesting especially because Tesforia has jumped on the Micronational space race.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Its also important to note that in some places, the materials are illegal, and are flagged/restricted purchases in other areas.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I believe funding would be nice, but for me personally I do not need it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
If this program is a reality we would probably only fund legal materials that can be used by people of their age and won't pose a risk
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Atiera is present
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
You would not be able to send model rocket engines in the mail.
But I assume other components would be easy to ship.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Through retailers yes but its pricey
It would be the GreenCities program but for space materials
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Then I don't think it would be worth it to send space parts.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Who is going to fund this?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
My bank account probably
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
CONPACT/CONSPACE
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Apologizes
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
There is also the IAC.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Whilst a good idea in theory, it doesn't really seem fair to have such a project rely solely on an individuals personal bank account... especially as noted earlier this will be pricey.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
It would be nice in the future, but i don’t think we have the funding.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
True
Regarding the GreenCities I'll still be funding the program after my chairmanship FYI.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Model rocketry can get pricey, I know from experience
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Mr. Sullivan.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Does anyone have anything further on this topic?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I just believe that such a program would require funds that we will probably not have in the future, which is why as of right now I am opposed to such unless if we find a way to fund such a program.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills:

About the whole government restrictions thing- you can buy the stuff you need to make a model rocket as a brand of stump remover, which might not set off the government.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia ie prezent.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Manufacturing pyrotechnics with stump remover isn't exactly kosher in such places.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd also like to point out that our only options are to either sell commercial motors or the materials to make them - the former is a bad idea because we're shipping literal explosives and the latter is an <strong>incredibly</strong> bad idea for obvious reasons.
Either way we shouldn't be looking into trading rocket motors or the means to produce them to inexperienced nations.

Alright, let's get started

West River is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Incoming Chair candidate Logan Ross has responded to me with his intended Cabinet- what is Parliament's views on this proposed cabinet? Do note that a majority of these positions do not require parliamentary approval, however Ross has chosen to attain parliamentary approval. <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WwDDao76PXv0IRh-PWXoHizpOiJrtHOn/view?usp=sharing">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1WwDDao76PXv0IRh-PWXoHizpOiJrtHOn/view?usp=sharing</a>

Note that Ross has not confirmed these positions and they are subject to change
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is present.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The proposed Minister of Technology seems like a fine chap. Jokes aside, I believe all these are fine choices.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I do have 2 issues with the intended cabinet
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark is no longer present.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The cabinet could be made before the new Superior Judge so I'll ask Ross regarding it
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I will review the cabinet plan. I shall feedback soon.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I support this Cabinet (although I may be a little biased, as I was chosen to continue my position), but I don't think that Jamez wants to return anytime soon.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It would appear that the intended choice for Superior Judge is a tad... questionable.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Could accidentally been left out when the new Superior Judge came in, again I'll ask Ross about it
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I did indeed gloss over that choice. All choices besides the choice for Superior Judge seem fine.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
With all due respect, they withdrew from the Cupertino Alliance— plus a majority of delegates voted for a motion of no confidence the previous month (I should note the candidate in question resigned prior to the completion of said vote).
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
They did not withdraw from the alliance with Woland representing the nation.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">I confirmed it with Jamez and is evident in the recent message in <span class="mention">#formal</span>
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Whilst we are still on this note, is a Minister of the Treasury necessary?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I don't really agree with the new ministerial position to be honest
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Could probably be integrated with another role as a side duty
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Just a few things to clear up.
1) The superior judge nomination is an outdated error that I must apologise for. This will remain as Mr. Sullivan
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The Treasury will likely be merged with a preexisting ministry as well.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do you have a more up-to-date outline?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As of right now no.
I will be providing an updated cabinet plan in the next few days to suit these changes though.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Any final comments before we move on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
None from me.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Otherwise, let's move on
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Per the recent popularity of space exploration organizations including Essexia and Aenopia's IAC and CONSPACE, from various member nations, the Cupertino Alliance is looking into the idea of opening up the GreenCities program to fund space projects.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
GreenCities has a list of approved seed vendors. Would this plan also need an approved vendors list?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Most likely but this would require a lot of research compared to the GC seed vendors
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That's exactly what I was getting to.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Elaborate
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
My question meant to imply that we would need to think about approved vendors, which would be complicated
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
During previous sessions I have voiced my disapproval in regards to this proposal because:
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The idea of funding and delivering parts for pyrotechnics has continually been shot down by this august body for legal, monetary and safety issues.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
At the end of the day if there's an injury or fatality involving a delegate, then it'll be the Chair that'll likely be responsible.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The best we could legally and feasibly do is a project for shared rocketry research and plans.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Any final discussion before we move on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">The best we could legally and feasibly do is a project for shared rocketry research and plans.
Also shall we move on?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright then
The next proposed project would be CuperChats, an TED Talk inspired group of videos intended for micronations. This project would probably utilize the same technology used in the CESE graphics but would also incorporate basic animation. Any feedback on this proposed idea?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Personally, I really like the idea
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It sounds like an interesting idea... though the name really needs to change.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This allows the idea of micronationalism to reach more audiences
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that it would be an interesting concept.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Name is based on TED Talks and I think it works personally
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
It sounds like a success.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur. With the right topics and a little advertising, it could be a great success.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Let's move on then
The Noted project is being transported to Wegmat then I'll receive it and pass it on to Humberlea, then Humberlea will send it back to me so that I can send it to Atiera.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">During this time, per a plurality in <span class="mention">#announcements</span>, a majority want me to scan the Noted project and publish it online as a checkpoint. Does anyone wish to comment on this?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think we owe it to the remaining recipients to keep the secret alive
The surprise is the best part in my opinion.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that this would be interesting for those who have already had or may not be able to participate.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur, but there are only a few recipients left. This could be wrapped up in a month or less depending on shipping times.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
A majority have voted to see it. If some some people want to keep it a surprise, they don't have to look at it. Perhaps it coukd be spoilered (for people not on PC, it is possible to spoiler images by manually tinkering with the filenames) to benefit both parties?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I'll research options on spoiling it.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes I think posting it through a spoiler or to imgur (or something similar) where the individual would have to manually go look at it, would work.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Any final comment before we move on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Should we keep this noted letter to the Americas and have a Eurasia letter as well or just have one?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I suppose a parliamentary vote regarding this matter would be the best option.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Otherwise, let's move on
As we conclude with the government's era of the major revival of projects, we would be working and finishing on projects including the CA Guides, Factbook, and Capstone Tribune this long weekend. We plan for the Capstone Tribune to come out on Saturday or Sunday, as well as the Factbook being published on Sunday or Monday. Work will continue on both chapters of the Guides.
Any questions or comments regarding this?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
To my knowledge, there is already a recipient in Ireland scheduled, and previously one in India.
I must note however, shipping costs will be an issue, though I'm unaware of what its like for letters.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I will try to work on the Capstone Tribune soon.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I had a parcel come recently from a... benefactor where the shipping cost $120 for them.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This is a letter
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Vishwamitra is no longer a member so it won't be going to India.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Hence previous.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Also I haven't heard much from Scoria lately?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Scoria hasn't been active lately.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I have not received word on their Factbook questions
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Maybe it's time to sift through our inactive members again then?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Scoria has a genuine reason. An array of medical and private issues.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Understandable.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Fair.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I have also spoke out to the Huai Shao delegate on recommendation of the Minister of Asian Affairs and they cited school, however they have opened an application for a CA delegate.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Yeah, that does seem understandable.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Back on the topic of revived programs, does anyone have a comment on this?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am genuinely surprised to see a revival of programs considering the campaign made a big deal out of slashing them— but this is an endeavour I fully wholeheartedly support, and will note is essential for this alliances existence to remain justified.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The revival of programs started all the way back to late Oct / early November if I recall
It's been an extremely long process which is near the conculsion
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's worth noting that these endeavours to revive these projects are part of the Lycon administration - of course we'll likely be taking a similar approach in the Ross administration as well.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur.
One final note- I've informed the Minister of Membership Attainment to update the Remark Reference Guide. Note that we plan to start a new volume with new remarks after 15 February 2021.

On a more ceremonial note, should the 2nd Parliament be started at the first session of the Ross administration or should the 1st Parliament title be continued. If the 2nd Parliament heading is chose, should it be stylized as

Point of Order.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe that it should be the latter.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This would be the third Parliament,

I think the latter option is good.

For the sake of practicality Efton and my governments are merged as there wasn't really an election
Plus we would have to change like 40 agendas
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I merged them, yes.

The agendas did say 1st Parliament and I do recall you opposing calling the post 1st parliament as Second Parliament at like August
Sebolivier: 
Georgienstine is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It would be a hassle of changing agendas from post 1st election but if Parliament wants to do it then sure
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We discussed this in late December/early January I believe, and it appeared the consensus changed.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Apologizes for the incorrect time
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
In such an event, I don't believe it is worth the hassle of retroactively editing every single previous document.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We can change it if you want but it'll be the people that want it changed that fi, all the documents.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
But the consensus from the current sitting parliament right now is to create a 2nd parliament instead of a 3rd parliament
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I don't recall any such question posed.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think it should be the first option.

Ah, I believed you were quoting the original question posed around 20-something September.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright
But the question still stands on what is our current Parliament number should be
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Hmm
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Pose the question then.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Maybe 1st?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Should sessions categorized after the 1st Cupertino Alliance chairmanship election to the final session today be cited as 1st Parliament or 2nd Parliament?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
If our parliament hasn't dissolved and reformed, we should call it the 1st parliament.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe it should be 2nd Parliament post-August. The other choice is blatantly incorrect.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

I have a question.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You have the floor.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
What happened to the Amendment to the Charter that I proposed a while ago?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Amendment XII?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Ah, the LGBT recognition one.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Seems to been lost, I'll put it to vote after the session.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Neat.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Apologizes.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
No problem. It is not that big of a deal, but I think that it will bring long-needed changes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There is one point of order however I must add.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You have the floor,
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Its name should be altered to Amendment XI.
Due to nonesuch existing.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Amendment XI is another lost amendment to ban minimodding.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It got withdraw-ed by me.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ah.
Should I edit the document to change it to XI and remove the mention to it?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
As per the prescient in Amendment I, the name should stay.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Alright.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe it should be removed, as it refers to items that do not exist.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think that the mention to XI should be removed though.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If this session has concluded then I must congratulate the Lycon administration for the past year of hard work, determination and perseverence. If it wasn't for your work then the rags-to-riches story of the Cupertino Alliance would never have happened. You have served as an influence to us all.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Amendment I was a bill which failed to pass, but it went into vote as opposed to XI.

This might be off-topic, but should there be a going-away party for Mr. Lycon?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
We'll probably just talk until 3:38PM EST.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Why 3:38?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Exact time when my term expires.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ah.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Thank you for your service to the Alliance, Mr. Lycon. You have inspired a great many people, and you have pulled this Alliance from being a widely regarded joke in the community to being one of the most respected micronational organisations.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thank you
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I should probably know this, but what day will your term expire?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
15 February 2021.
Today is the last session.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I see.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have any further affairs to discuss?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I would infer the new Cabinet taking seat at the next session which Ross would have to determine.
Again, Ross did want Parliament to confirm the positions.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
One final note, would Mr. Montan's amendment wish to be elevated under Urgent Proposal status?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
What do you mean by that?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The bill will have a voting period of only 1 day.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I see.
I think it should be.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Alright, please add a urgent proposal justification per the rules.
Regarding the parliamentary number question, I will be moving an act to solve this issue. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hz4E3d9s7XmMoF8fhjE924Jk3oWQYyDRbreRP9VFMDM/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Hz4E3d9s7XmMoF8fhjE924Jk3oWQYyDRbreRP9VFMDM/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Welcome and thank you to everyone for attending tonight's session.
This is a historic session marking the transition over from the 2nd Parliament to the 3rd, and will see some important changes enacted in order to make the Cupertino Alliance more effective and professional.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Tesforia is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Just a few things first:
Anyone wish to add anything?
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Nothing here.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright excellent.
We shall start off with the new Cabinet plan.
As far as I'm aware that is the new cabinet plan however if there's anything incorrect on this then please notify me.
The floor is open to discussion.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

Logan Ross - Aenopia:

LamentTwice: 
I do believe I was offered a position, was that changed?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is this copy of the cabinet plan up to date?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It should be unless I selected the wrong one?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Was Mr Sullivan not being considered for Superior Judge?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
My sincerest apologies it looks as if I uploaded the old plan.
I shall upload the new one in a moment.
Again I apologise - I really need to organise my files.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present, apologies for being late.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As you can see I've made some changes to the plan, including the appointment of Thorin Neal and Konstantinos.
I understand the inactivity of Mr. Neal however I wish to give him the chance to show his metal and hopefully improve his activity levels.
It is fairly risky to nominate an individual who hasn't shown a huge amount of activity however I'm willing to give him a chance.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This certainly looks like an intriguing plan.
LamentTwice: 
You may have to appoint a reserve minister, in case he doesn't show activity.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Aswington is present now.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We do have the Deputy American Minister of course.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qaflana present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Noted.
If Mr. Neal doesn't show signs of activity within a month of his appointment, then it will be up to Parliament to decide his fate.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I'll have to double check that, because I believe it was amended to place the burden of selection on the ministers themselves.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed it was.
That's why it's classed as TBC on my plan.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything else before we move on?
LamentTwice: 
No.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
None here.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Brilliant.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
May I ask that I could select the successor to my ministry position?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
You were Minister of Agreements, were you not?
LamentTwice: 
He was.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yes
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Of course then go ahead.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Could I address my selection after the session agenda is completed to give me some time?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Of course.
Moving on we have the topic of Server Moderators.
As part of my sweeping plan to increase professionalism and decorum wherever possible, I wish to appoint 2-3 delegates of opposite time zones who would moderate any breaks in formality in our formal channels or any arguments.
Now for while we already have Ministers with server permissions, I wish to appoint individuals whom solely focus on maintaining decorum, be it ministers or regular delegates.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
May I become a moderator?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is the floor open?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It will be up to Parliament to decide.
<div class="quote">Is the floor open?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I do not believe the position of Server Moderator is necessary, and in my opinion is made redundant by the pre-existing Bureau de Administration.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Shall we move on then?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Next up we have the idea of allowing news representatives of accredited newspapers access to <span class="mention">#formal-members-pub</span>.
I'm gonna leave the floor open as I'm rather conflicted with this motion.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Chair?
I believe this idea is ridiculous.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That is fair enough.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I strongly concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anyone wish to add anything else before we move on?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
None from Saspearian
LamentTwice: 
I also concur. That is a bad idea, as some newspapers can report on internal affairs that aren't to be seen by the public. Either don't do it, or create an act which these papers have to agree on before being let in. Take action on any infractions of that hypothetical act.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I too concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think the strong opposition from everyone is enough to can that idea.
Moving onwards to a Cupertino fundraiser event.
This is something that I supported during my campaign and so as a result I wish to begin planning this as soon as possible.
The plan is to host a digital/physical event of some sort (extended quorum, e-summit, mass-cleanup, ect.) in order to raise money for a cause, be it one of our internal programs such as the Greencities program or even a charity.
Now you may have noticed that I gave the 69hr session as an example, because for while the session was highly controversial and something that we will not be attempting again, it is a clear example of a Cupertino-led fundraising session in the past.
The floor is open to ideas and suggestions.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What sort of charities do you have in mind?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">What sort of charities do you have in mind?
Any other ideas are appreciated.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I support the idea of charities and fundraisers, but I'd like to see more ideas for events and how those events can generate funds. For example, I'm curious about how holding a session could help us raise money.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Not the outright copy the GUM, but the Grand Unified Micronational was able to raise upwards of &#163;200 in charity with an extended session
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
During the GUM's 24hr sessions, delegates are encouraged to leave some money via forms.
Indeed what Matthew said.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I see, thank you for the clarification.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Overall I'd support the fundraising being split 50/50 between projects and a charity as I believe that is the best way.
LamentTwice: 
As in CA development projects?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes like Greencities.
I believe that would be the best way to fund the Greencities program in my opinion.
Anybody wish to add anything else?
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" style="color: rgb(94, 197, 171); background-color: rgba(94, 197, 171, 0.1);">@Members</span>
Rory - Lurdentania: 
None
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then moving onwards.
Just a few weeks ago the GUM hosted a fairly successful Awards ceremony, aimed towards awarding developing nations for factors such as technology, design, culture, ect.
For while I don't suggest outright copying the GUM I propose that we host an awards ceremony for delegates and nations for showing increased development and activity within the Cupertino Alliance.
The floor is open.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I agree
I think it is good to award people for there hard work.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Cupertino Alliance Ribbon, and its Citizen Class variant have been long neglected since the Spring of 2020 (Whether Efton and Watta were ever awarded theirs is not clear. I cannot find evidence suggesting it was followed through.).
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I also concur with Mr Ross that we should not just copy the GUM,
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I couldn't agree more with Mr. Valentinus.
On top of the inactive awards we can also introduce new awards for individual features of member states.
If we reward nations for development and professionalism, then it will just encourage more of the above.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yeah
LamentTwice: 
I believe we should rename the Cupertino Alliance Ribbon to the Cupertino Alliance Service Ribbon.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What form would the awards be? Electronic, a medal or a certificate and who would decides its awardees
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I think it might already be called that.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">What form would the awards be? Electronic, a medal or a certificate and who would decides its awardees
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Cupertino_Service_Ribbon">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Cupertino_Service_Ribbon</a>
Cupertino Service Ribbon</div>
The Cupertino Service Ribbon or Cupertino Citizenship Recognition Ribbon is the highest official honour in the Cupertino Alliance. It was founded on 7 March 2020 by Jayden Lycon after the departure of Archie Birch from the Alliance.</div>
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It would be easier if we supplied the awardees with a link to a printable version of the certificate.
LamentTwice: 
I see.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is no longer present
LamentTwice: 
It also appears that Watta has definitely been awarded this in the past, but Efton hasn't.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens provides all certificates and badges digitally for free. Some physical certificates and medals are provided free of charge if the recipient pays the shipping. Other more expensive physical medals are completely paid for by the recipient.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There was a vote for a mandate to award the award as per the system at the time, but I can't find evidence to suggest these writs were executed.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
If shipping costs are a problem, we could pay delegates located closer to the recipient to produce the certificate.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
This is a good idea.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I know multiple stores near me that make custom certificates.
Or you could just get special paper and print it out.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">If shipping costs are a problem, we could pay delegates located closer to the recipient to produce the certificate.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It is also a concern that some delegates will not wish to share their home addresses. For fairness, the PDF approach would be better.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I'm not sure about other companies in other countries, but I know that FedEx, for example, will print anything onto nice card stock paper for around $0.60. If there is a local print shop, they might be able to provide affordable printing to those who don't own a printer themselves.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Could I also propose a Cuperinto Alliance Chairman’s Award? Given to one person a year by the incumbent chairman
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This already exists.
It is known as the Lycon Cross.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Ok
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Shall we move on then?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Moving on we have the Charter reform committee.
For while the current charter has served us well, it is quickly starting to show its age.
As part of my term I wish to produce a new charter which takes into account the changes in the CA's purpose.
The floor is open.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
LamentTwice: 
We should have a group of people draft an updated charter.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I would be willing to help out in reforming the Charter.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's the plan.
<div class="quote">I would be willing to help out in reforming the Charter.
I believe that the Superior Judge should be the head of this committee (alongside myself) to provide much-needed experience.
Anybody wish to add anything else?
LamentTwice: 
No.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Chair?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to recommend Mr Koehler of Australis, and Lord Lewis of Lundenwic for this Committee. I believe those two individuals would provide a great boon to the reformation.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
They have been suggested previously however I'll keep them in mind as I message them later this evening.
Moving onwards I would like to announce that over the next few days I will be doing a spring cleaning of our Discord server.
I'm sure that many of you will agree with me that we have lots of unused, unnecessary channels which can either be merged with another channel or deleted/archived.
This way I hope to make the server easier to navigate and subsequently better for aspiring members.
Any discussion in regards to this?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Which channels do you have in mind to archive?
I would also like to stress that unless absolutely necessary, to avoid outright deletion of channels.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
That is why the Archive category exists
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">There are plenty of useless channels, such as <span class="mention">#deleted-channel</span>
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I can confirm that I won't be deleting any channels.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Look what category is it in
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I just realized that that’s archived, I apologize.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<span class="mention">#deleted-channel</span> and <span class="mention">#our-mission</span> could be merged under one channel serving the same purpose rather than having 3.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I believe that our mission should be kept as its seperate channel to be honest
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I was thinking of having a #read-me channel like on the GUM server instead.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I would keep our mission as its more symbolic to be honest
And easy for quick reference
LamentTwice: 
channel to #rules-and-read-me
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I would keep our mission as its more symbolic to be honest
Anybody wish to add anything else?
Moving onwards then we have the revitalisation of the Cupertino Gazette and external social medias.
The Capstone Tribune has shown that there is a huge interest in news regarding the Cupertino Alliance and her member states, and I feel as if by revitalising the Cupertino Gazette to report on sessions, events, programs, ect. individuals in the wider community will be more supportive and more likely to join.
As well as this, I also hope to revitalise/create social media accounts for the Cupertino Alliance on major micronational hotspots such as Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, ect. to be operated by the Minister of Public Affairs.
This way we can reach out to more nations that we would otherwise not encounter in the MicroWiki community.
The floor is open.

Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then next up we have the weather system update.
I have contacted Daniel Roscoe of Australis in regards to his system, and I'm hoping for a response back with a link to his weather system soon.
In the meantime I will be taking applications for the weather system, which to those who don't know is a bot which is added to member Discord servers.
Anybody wish to add any further comments?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I'm wondering if people find the use of this program though
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's why I'm taking applications now rather than later.
If there is a lack of interest then I'll just cancel the project.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I have an interest in the project, but I'm not entirely clear on how it works. Do member nations provide the weather data through weather stations?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Previous IFTTT system had data autotracked and an alert would go out if it reached a certain tempature
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Essentially the bot will provide weather data to the server through external websites such as BBC weather or metoffice.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
But we are unable to use IFTTT due to the recent paid requirement
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As far as I'm aware the Australis bot is a home-grown bot if you will.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I see, thank you both for clarifying.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Moving on then.
Next up we have the roles of Treasury and Head of Graphics.
During the last session someone suggested that the Treasury be merged with another existing ministry so I'll just talk about the Head of Graphics.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Maybe make it a dual mandate role (akin to like Ministry of Justice / Attorney General) to like Ministry of Graphics and Exchequer General / Secretary of the Treasury?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Essentially they would be the head of designing graphics such as the Super Nintendo 64 project and other areas which require digital designs.
<div class="quote">Maybe make it a dual mandate role (akin to like Ministry of Justice / Attorney General) to like Ministry of Graphics and Exchequer General?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Honestly, I don’t... because there would be too many nations the weather bot would have to report on.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Each webhook manages 1 nation so it won't get overloaded
I'm just worrying if it would get annoying to everyone
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If people find it annoying then they could always mute the channel.
Regardless we'll see how many people apply for the project before making any bold decisions.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Anyways we shall move on to the applications. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(94, 197, 171); background-color: rgba(94, 197, 171, 0.1);">@Members</span>

Ah, maybe the act could expire at the end of each chairs term, and if we trust them once more we re-propose the act to go until the end of there term etc.
LamentTwice: 
Good idea.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Anyway, back to memberships.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Ah, maybe the act could expire at the end of each chairs term, and if we trust them once more we re-propose the act to go until the end of there term etc.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
That would be too big of a thing to not just justify a vote in Parliament.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anyways onwards with the applications - we can continue discussing this later.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Executive Rejections usually must fulfil certain criteria, no?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Next up we have Plushunia
Plushunia</div>
Plushunia (IPA (English): [plʌʃu:nia], Romanian: Plușunia, IPA (Romanian): [pluʃu:nia]) is a Romanian micronation and electorate of the Holy Roman Empire founded on 20 October 2017 by incumbent President Cristian Dobrev. It claims five landlocked regions surrounded entirely by Romania. An important aspect of Plushunia is that it recognises toys ...</div>
LamentTwice: 
As suggested by Isaiah Burdette, We should make it so that the chair executively reject but has to report it to the parliament and the Parliament can overturn it.
James B. - Desert District: 
I am glad to be able to know the leader of Plushunia and think they would be a valuable part of this Alliance.
I wholeheartedly support their entry.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I must state that I fully support Cristi and Plushunia's application - Cristi is a great man who I have known since the OAM and there is no reason why I would oppose their application.
LamentTwice: 
Anyways, Plushunia is a yes.
Ely: 
Isn’t plushunia known for having stuffed animals as citizens
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I support their entry too.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Yes.
James B. - Desert District: 
That is correct.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
That’s what I thought
James B. - Desert District: 
I don’t think that disqualifies them.
LamentTwice: 
That is their entire premise.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed but we shouldn't reject an incredibly professional nation because of their plush population.
James B. - Desert District: 
They are in the GUM and have been valuable members their and have had no issues with it.
Ely: 
Fair enough
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I will be Abstaining
Ely: 
I support the admission of Plushunia
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Can I ask where are the remarks?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That would be my fault.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I was not informed by the Chair of any duties, but I apologize for not writing said remarks.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I apologise for any miscommunications.
It will not happen again.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Understand.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Moving on we have the Duchy of Ponchartrain-Maurepas
Duchy of Pontunia</div>
Pontunia, officially the Duchy of Pontchartrain-Maurepas, is an independent micronation that amicably seceded from the Austenasian Crown Dependency of New Pontunia in February 2021. It is comprised of various residential properties and two public parks declared independent from Metairie, Louisiana under the leadership of Duke Andrew I.</div>
James B. - Desert District: 
Their delegate has shown prior immaturity over and over.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This was their primary delegate in someone's DMs.
No reason whatsoever to admit this application.
LamentTwice: 
I shall abstain.
James B. - Desert District: 
When a part of Austenasia delegate applied to countless micronational organizations despite being told numerous times by their leader they were not sovereign and could not apply.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Their delegate lied in their application last time.
LamentTwice: 
They are also too young as well.
James B. - Desert District: 
They have engaged in unprofessional behavior that goes above and beyond what is seen above.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I gonna abstain too.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I shall vote against
James B. - Desert District: 
I believe their entry would lower this Alliance’s reputation.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Same as you.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
This will inevitably be an unpopular opinion, but why not. I think he has learned his lesson, and Pontunia is independent now anyways.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
He's older than I am, what are you talking about?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Young as in nation age
I suppose
James B. - Desert District: 
The nation.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ah.
LamentTwice: 
Yes.
James B. - Desert District: 
He has told members to burn in hell and threatened to kill himself when approached about his unprofessional behavior.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their nation has only been independent for the past week or two.
James B. - Desert District: 
It’s been barely a few months since he did this, I don’t think that’s enough to magically change as a person.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Take into account his behaviour as an individual and his nation it's definitely going to be an oppose from me.
James B. - Desert District: 
If he comes back in say May or so maybe I’ll reconsider but until then there’s no reason to believe he’s changed.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
We do not know about his home life, there could very easily be more behind the scenes.
James B. - Desert District: 
That doesn’t excuse behavior like that.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">We do not know about his home life, there could very easily be more behind the scenes.
We don't know the home life of anyone here, so why should we use that as a base for an application?
As Jamez said, if they show continued growth and professionalism by May I'd be willing to give them a shot.
But not now.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Mr. Ross.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I guess, but again, we do not know if there is more.
James B. - Desert District: 
How does that justify this?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Exactly. We don't.
James B. - Desert District: 
If he has mental health struggles etc. I’m sorry to hear that and I wish him the best but that doesn’t mean you can harass delegates. Period.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think that I will vote against for now, but a crowd of people online screaming at him for his nation could easily push him over the edge.
About the burn in hell comment, that is obviously bad.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">As I've just said to him in <span class="mention">#informal</span>, if he puts in the effort to change and grow then I'd be willing to give him a chance in a few months time.
Shall we move on?
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Yes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Hellenic Empire of Cimbrun
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Is there any other information like a constitution, MicroWiki, or anything else?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The lack of MicroWiki page is a big factor in their application for me, however considering the professionalism that their leader has shown, I'd be willing to give them a chance as an Observer.
<div class="quote">Is there any other information like a constitution, MicroWiki, or anything else?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Hm. The information provided doesn’t give us a good understanding of there nation.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I have had very strange interactions with their leader.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
It does not have much information. If he had a Microwiki page...
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This is all I could find on the internet: <a href="https://www.reddit.com/r/micronations/comments/llf8j9/join_cimbrun_today/">https://www.reddit.com/r/micronations/comments/llf8j9/join_cimbrun_today/</a>
r/micronations - Join Cimbrun today!</div>
1 vote and 3 comments so far on Reddit</div>
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe their leader originally had been immature, but their leader seems professional nowadays.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Don't get me wrong: their leader seems professional from the contact I've had from them but their lack of information is a bit of a red flag.
I will be abstaining on this application.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Hellenic_Empire_of_Cimbrun">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Hellenic_Empire_of_Cimbrun</a>
Hellenic Empire of Cimbrun</div>
The Hellenic Empire of Cimbrun is a sovereign state, commonly called a micronation by outside observers, and the latest incarnation of the Cimbrunese Imperium. It plans on obtaining land in the State of Arkansas within the United States. Initially established as the Empire of Orini in 2018, Cimbrun is an absolute monarchy, although the Basileu...</div>
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Thanks
James B. - Desert District: 
I might have a concern about this nation.
I won’t say it until it’s confirmed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">The first incarnation of Orini was founded sometime during 2019, most likely January or February. It was very immature and simulationist at this point, joining in such horrid activities such as raiding, and immediately got banned from Vryland (2018-2019), as the then-Emperor had a temporary lapse of sanity in front of the former King of Vryland, as well as one involving Krainego. It got involved in a UN-style YAMO, where the Emperor found a case in favor of Cycoldia instead of Etukan, leading to a Great Micronational War that was settled after the Emperor backed out after accidentally raiding a neutral party. The first incarnation fell soon after the war due to being nuked.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Okay. Now, perhaps I could support that country in joining the organization (now with the Microwiki page). But, I will make my decision later.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I will still abstain until further information is provided like maybe a constitution???
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
He is also very involved with the Nexan Republic, which did not stop their war with Almendria until November, and he seemed to support the conflict.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that alone is enough to continue abstaining.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Shall we move on?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I should not hold grudges, but he raided the Ponderosan Discord server with vorarephilic pornography a bit over a year ago.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Decorum.
LamentTwice: 
Again, that was a long time ago.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
He has also tried to put his past behind him.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Just because it was a long time ago doesn’t mean they didn’t do it.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes, but that still leaves a bad impression on a person.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
For while I feel as if they may not be ready this week, if they continue to develop over the next 2-3 weeks then they might have a better chance of being accepted.
Moving on though we have Kingdom of Burdette
Kingdom of Burdette</div>
The Kingdom of Burdette, more commonly known simply as Burdette, is a self-declared sovereign state more commonly referred to as a micronation by external observers.

However, they are a good and professional nation. I wish for them to join.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I find their leader to be a bit hypocritical.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I  find their leader to be a bit hypocritical.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Isiah Burdette is a well known and respected Micronationalist. Furthermore we should start judging nations on there country not leader. I am a citizen of Burdette and I believe that they are very professional.
LamentTwice: 
The leader is the face of the nation, hence why we judge by nation and leadership.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
<div class="quote">They [TOES] had a simulationist raiding war with Almendria with some nations that are, respected in the community participated in the war.

LamentTwice: 
Burdette participated in the Ernest Civil War.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
That was around 9 months ago
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes, that is what I am referring to- how he was once a server raider but criticizes TOES for its involvement, which was completely satirical, in the Almendrian conflict.

I know, I just mentioned it to affirm the accusation of hypocrisy.

I've read into the remarks, and my opinion stands.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I haven't seen much activity from them either unless I'm wrong.
James B. - Desert District: 
I have an issue regarding an applicant.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
They seem like they would be a great member state, but as they are located in Thailand, their leaders could be more disposed to legal consequences if they are part of an alliance of other secessionists.

And?

Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
Wow.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If we decide to implement executive rejections in the future, then please let me know about any stuff like that before the session.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Most micronations are at least de facto digital.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It is critical that I find out about this kind of behaviour before we take the application to voting.
James B. - Desert District: 
I didn’t know.
Until literally a minute ago.
I would’ve alerted you earlier if I could have.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I wasn't expecting you to know however it's just going out to everyone for the future.
And on that note unless anybody wishes to add anything further or propose any motions we will be wrapping up tonight's session at 22:14UCT with a total time of 2 hours and 14 minutes.

Welcome everyone and thank you for attending today's session.
This is my first session, so please bear with me as we go through our agenda.
Ian - Ponderosa Hills: 
I have actually no idea what I'm doing so I'll be here silently, observing.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Remember, 
Anything we need to add to it?
No?
I'm guessing not.
So I think we should begin with a discussion about reviving old programs.
The floor is open to discussion.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Okay, what programs should be revived?
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Apologies for my absence, could barely squeeze this in.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's alright.
Sorry I am freezing up.
I'm trying to think of programs that actually need reviving.
Actually scratch that, i want to open up with the talk about reforming this server.
I believe we need to make this server less complicated.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Mr. Speaker. That is not related to the alliance specifically.
The server is not the alliance.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Oh I understand, sorry I was looking at agenda topics and mixing it with the alliance.
friendly ghost: 
But to be fair, our server is unnecessarily complex.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We could make the argument the discord directly affects the alliance.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
But I am only asking why an administrative issue is being put on the agenda of the alliance’s business
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True, I am sorry about that.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">But I am only asking why an administrative issue is being put on the agenda of the alliance’s business
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Cupertino Alliance Area of Natural Interest.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Mr Chair, the organization of the discord server is not of top priority.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The program fell short due to inactivity, and I feel like we can revive it.
Let's not argue about separate matters in here.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have returned.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think the program is fairly new and I don’t think it is inactive, I just think that perhaps people are not ready for it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur, it is a giant leap but I is still dead.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If I may, we have great foundations for said project, but unfortunately it appeared the cabinet never followed through with their plans.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
How so?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concu r
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I believe the program has huge potential.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I believe that the project could be  a breakthrough for both diplomacy and the local envrionments of these states like the GUM's sister city program.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It is important to protect areas of importance within our nations, and reviving it will form relationships and bonds within Cupertino.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
LamentTwice: 
There is also the VOIP project
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think as the lines of keeping up the environment and preserving history is great, and back to what logan said, a breakthrough. in what cupertino could do.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That project was canned as Mr. Montan was having issues with the software. At least, that I recall anyway.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
He needed a ethernet cable correct?
VoIP began before I went into the cupertino alliance.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I can't remember, it hasn't been spoken of in months.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
His last update read <strong>UPDATE ON THE CUPERTINO VOIP SYSTEM</strong>
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Theres your answer.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The last known talk about VoIP was Leon suggesting to retry it for the third time.
<a href="https://discord.com/channels/554799257643647005/751546608327458837/774034131159351357" onclick="scrollToMessage(event, '774034131159351357')">https://discord.com/channels/554799257643647005/751546608327458837/774034131159351357</a>
LamentTwice: 
I see.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I believe we need to work towards reviving CAoNI first, we could discuss with Leon about the VoIP project on a different note.
It would work well if we could use software to call eachother without something like discord, our own project.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If I may, are enough people going to use it to justify the projects existence?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That is true.
It would be helpful to call someone when somethings up though.
This VoIP system would allow citizens of CA member states to use software or actual phones to call each other through our own phone numbers.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The thing about the VOIP project is that for while it sounds like an incredibly cool project, it seems like quite a niche thing in reality.
Afterall we all have Discord, emails, MW talk pages, ect.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
^^^
We have so many forms of communication.
That it goes back to the argument of are enough people going to use it.
It is more of a concept and not much of an idea, however in the future we could possibly discuss it, unlikely however.
<a href="https://discord.com/channels/554799257643647005/668551207005978625/734452817489821696" onclick="scrollToMessage(event, '734452817489821696')">https://discord.com/channels/554799257643647005/668551207005978625/734452817489821696</a>
There was a poll conducted a while back asking if you would participate in the program.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yeah I see no reason for the VoIP project to be a top priority in project revival.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
So CAoNI is top priority, or would someone would like to add another program they would like to see revived?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
It’s fine, I suppose
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, lets move onto another topic.
Getting a topic, give me a minute.
I believe we should host more fundraising sessions.
It is a topic we don't discuss much, but I think it would honestly mean alot to charities if we did so.
We had multiple sessions in the past, and they were generally sucessful.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that fundraising sessions would be a mix of donating to charity and funding CA projects such as Greencities.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur, the money we raise would help everyone in that situation.
What we need to discuss most is how we are going to set it up.
Like for example how are we going to set up a donation thing.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If you refer to charitable sessions, we have only had one.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that we should do it through a gofundme or other fundraising sites online.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
If we set it up through a fundraising site we need to make sure its clear its going to us aswell.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Preferably, one that doesn't have a high commission.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It would be weird if we said Donate to this charity and in the description 50% of profits go to Cupertino Alliance.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.

What charity would we donate to?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
During the last session I suggested:
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
What I suggest is Red Cross.
In 2019 I went homeless due to my house collapsing, and red cross was on the scene and gave us a total of 1k + toiletries and different items.
They gave us a week extra at the motel we were staying at.
They are one charity I know that would do great.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would be wary of Oxfam. 
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Oxfam?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
About the VoIP project- I got an ethernet cable (although it turns out I had one in my house that I didn't know I had), but I couldn't get the software working, and didn't really have the motivation to work on it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Thank you about that.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Also, I believe that my Raspberry Pi is broken now, as it didn't show anything on my TV when I turned it on, although the lights on the Pi were on, the cable might have just been broken.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don't think we should support oxfam as a charity.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<a href="https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/oxfam-child-abuse-haiti-scandal-inquiry-sexual-exploitation-charity-commission-a8953566.html">https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/home-news/oxfam-child-abuse-haiti-scandal-inquiry-sexual-exploitation-charity-commission-a8953566.html</a>

Senior&#160;staff&#160;failed to&#160;alert law enforcement to allegations&#160;aid workers were having sex with minors, a damning Charity Commission report concludes</div>
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<a href="https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti">https://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jun/15/timeline-oxfam-sexual-exploitation-scandal-in-haiti</a>
Timeline: Oxfam sexual exploitation scandal in Haiti</div>
Key events in aftermath of news that Oxfam covered up inquiry into staff paying for sex</div>
Following these scandals, I think the money would be used for the incorrect purpose.
Does anyone have any good charities?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Rather sad that people working for what should be a good cause have abused or abuse this system.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, donating money to a charity to give to the poor, then them using the money to get sex work and different actions.
So, next session we should discuss further into the case of fundraising.
It would be a great topic to go further into.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Shall we move on then?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, let me get another topic.
I think for our next topic, it should be about revitalizing the cupertino gazette and social medias.
I think we could do alot more advertising with our social medias.
I think we should get a instagram page.
With instagram, advertising is made simple.
Ive advertised on instagram before, free of charge for the first advert.
And I was able to pull in so many people to my profile.
And I think there is alot more individuals who would actually like the concept of micronations and CA but have never heard of it.
And it would benefit us, and our nations individually.
Here was the results from my past promotion.
2000 people came to my profile, 2600 saw the advert.
Now we can do that but with advertising techniques, and more would come and join us.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I have the floor, regarding the Gazette?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes you may.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
In Spring, the duty of the Gazette was transferred to the Minister of Public Affairs to spare the workload.
LamentTwice: 
May I also add to that?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I cede the floor.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
You may.
LamentTwice: 
The Gazette was also lead by Efransa, who has been expelled. If we want to bring it back, we'll need someone who is capable to do it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We would need someone with dedication to cupertino.
LamentTwice: 
Also, I believe the Capstone Tribune largely replaced the Gazette - as it mostly reports on micronations centred around the CA.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True, we could also consider the Tribune as the new Gazette
James B. - Desert District: 
It would essentially be a successor?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, it fufills alot of things about the gazette before it died.
LamentTwice: 
Does the Nutmeg also report on the Tribune as it does with other member news posts?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
The Nutmeg Project isn't related to the Capstone Tribune I believe
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The responsibility lies with the Public Affairs ministry, as noted in law.
I would like to clarify that Miss Lewes hailed from the Efransa delegation, as Mr. Konstant&#237;nos mentioned earlier.
LamentTwice: 
I should expect that our new Public Affairs Minister shall do better.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think that the CA's social media accounts should be all administered by different people, as in one person running the Instagram, one person running the Twitter, and so on.
James B. - Desert District: 
Unnecessary.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Are we posting all the same posts across the social medias?
LamentTwice: 
Yes.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Unnecessary than.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe that a formal recommendation should be presented to the ministry.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This is generally the ministry of public affairs issues.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I hope under the new leadership some of these qualms will be settled.
Anything left to add?
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Lets move onto member applications. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(94, 197, 171); background-color: rgba(94, 197, 171, 0.1);">@Members</span>
James B. - Desert District: 
Alright.
LamentTwice: 
Ok.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
So we have a micronation called Prudentianopolis that applied.
<a href="https://discord.com/invite/a8vdypp">https://discord.com/invite/a8vdypp</a>

Prudentianopolis or Philosopher Confederation of Prudentianopolis[1] or unofficially Molcian Confederation (Molco for short) is a non-territorial sovereign entity in Southeast Asia from 2019, ruled by Knowledge for All Party, only legalized and the ruling party in Prudentianopolis after the reformation of Molco on 15 December 2019.

Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Prudentianopolis is a non-territorial nation. this is a bit concerning for me
Also their population claim of 430 on their microwiki doesn't seem as if it is true
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Also, whats concerning is that there is little information on any culture about their micronation.
LamentTwice: 
If I have to be honest, most of our nations function without territory - although we have claims to land.
James B. - Desert District: 
Seems like they lied about a population.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They only have 54 members in discord, it seems far fetched.
James B. - Desert District: 
That should warrant an exceutive rejection.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They don't seem to have much information on them, and they seem to have (most likely) lied.
LamentTwice: 
I'll abstain on this one.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
?
Or is it a flat out rejection.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Likely a vote, since executive rejection is a power only designated to the Chair
Actually the application has to be reviewed in all other regional sessions, so no vote yet
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright.
Then is that all this session?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Are there not more topics on the agenda?

Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia:

Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don't have Vishwamitra's app.
Logan gave me only Prudentianopolis.
Let me set up a vote.

My sincerest apologies I've been juggling a few things and to rub salt into the wound my wifi has been playing up a lot tonight.

The floor is open.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
They seem fine for observership
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur also.
friendly ghost: 
I also concur.
Asher Young - Qaflana: 
I have no idea if I am qualified to concur or not, but if so, I do.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Everybody can concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
State of Vishwamitra

Another yes, as Vishwamitra is very professional.
Ian - Ponderosa Hills: 
There wiki page is very professional and has GA status notably
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I must quickly state something.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur, they are centered.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
For while I no doubt support the application of Vishwamitra, I must alert you all that following recommendations from delegates I will be discussing a potential investigation into their representative Dhrub for events which led to his prior suspension.
If they provide another delegate in the meanwhile then I'll support them all the way.
I won't go into the details for their potential investigation though.
I cede.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That is true, I can't fully support them yet, if Dhrub is the delegate.
Plushunia

Plushunia (IPA (English): [plʌʃu:nia], Romanian: Plușunia, IPA (Romanian): [pluʃu:nia]) is a Romanian micronation and electorate of the Holy Roman Empire founded on 20 October 2017 by incumbent President Cristian Dobrev. It claims five landlocked regions surrounded entirely by Romania. An important aspect of Plushunia is that it recognises toys ...</div>
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I wholeheartedly support the application of Plushunia.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur, the wiki page seems well rounded, and a nice fit in CA.
LamentTwice: 
I concur, they belong here.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Moving on we have the Duchy of Ponchartrain-Maurepas
Duchy of Pontunia</div>
Pontunia, officially the Duchy of Pontchartrain-Maurepas, is an independent micronation that amicably seceded from the Austenasian Crown Dependency of New Pontunia in February 2021. It is comprised of various residential properties and two public parks declared independent from Metairie, Louisiana under the leadership of Duke Andrew I.</div>
What do you think about this MN.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
With everything that had just occured within Pontunia as of recent, I'm going to have to say no.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Absolutely not
Asher Young - Qaflana: 
From my experience, Pontunia is consumed in political turmoil, and the Duke regularly collaborates with fascists
LamentTwice: 
No.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I thought so, the MN article seems unprofessional.
LamentTwice: 
They aren't ready to join.
Asher Young - Qaflana: 
My veto is furthered by the possibility of him using racial slurs, and then denying it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hellenic Empire of Cimbrun
Finally, this.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I'll have to abstain on this one.
James B. - Desert District: 
They had an NSFW channel with no restrictions. It has been deleted since but still warrants concern.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They have no wiki also.
Asher Young - Qaflana: 
No wiki = instant no from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
NVM, just mispelled it, and this is all the info they gave.

Warmedic - Monmark: 
What?
The Wiki is not a universal tool.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
?
Using it as a tool to check apps.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
There doesen't appear to be much information about it.
Asher Young - Qaflana: 
Hmm.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I believe that a MW page is one of the most important parts of an application because it is the biggest reflection of the nation.
Asher Young - Qaflana: 
I think the wiki is okay, so I retract my veto and give a reluctant yes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
But I concur there isn't much information in regards to the nation.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
MicroWiki is deeply unpopular in some circles because the Mods dislike how they manage their nations or something else.
Asher Young - Qaflana: 
There isn't a heap of information, but they don't look simulationist or anything.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Following this with the lack of info makes me think a no.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Is there any possible way to motion for a definite postponement on this proposal, until we get more information?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

As far as I'm aware no.
We could postpone further readings in future sessions though.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Are we using RRoO?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It depends on what other delegates and the applicant things.
<div class="quote">Are we using RRoO?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Robert's Rules of Order
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Pretty much yes.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Is there a committee that this can be refered to and have them find something out?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The closest we have to a committee is the Minister of Membership Attainment.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Their duty being?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Logan’s wifi went off I believe.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Who is the other person that would be in charge of this session?

Warmedic - Monmark: 
Right, well what is the duty of the Membership Attianment Ministry?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Apologies I'm back (temporarily).
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Good to have you back, hopefully there are less interruptions in future.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I cannot promise anything unfortunately.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I honestly don’t know their duty.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They write remarks and assist with applications essentially.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Than I motion for a referral to their ministry, I think it is very premature to vote against them or for them because of the lack of information. They should have a fair shot.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Speaking of which, I almost forgot to do the inactive member discussion.
Warmedic - Monmark:

Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
So, formerly me.
Then we have Huai Sao
We have West River.
And finally* Georgienstine
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have returned.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Any additions to the inactive list
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Can you blame them that much?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Many Representatives are assigned to the CA almost as a punishment.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
To be fair we have ~3 sessions a week with the ability to contact any one of 4 people to alert them that they cannot attend a session.

I mean really, they say they are present but add nothing to the current conversation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Not to mention the insane scheduling of these sessions.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Huai Siao is a Thai micronation, and one of our few Asian members. Due to the political situation in Thailand, it can be difficult for them.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Not to mention the insane scheduling of these sessions.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur, I can somewhat see Huai Siao making a effort.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Time zones aren't the issue.
People have school, jobs and they cannot attend meetings at 9 in the morning or 2 in the morning.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well I disagree, someone could host a meeting at 10 am and it be 2 am for someone else.
Time-zones are a major component.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
They are, but they are not the reason people don't join the sessions.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well, I didn't join a lot of sessions because of timezone differences.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">People have school, jobs and they cannot attend meetings at 9 in the morning or 2 in the morning.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
That are what they do.
I should know, I am one.
But again, the Vast <u><strong>VAST</strong></u> majority of people have jobs, and school and college.
Are they supposed to have 5 year old delegates?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
What are you trying to argue about? You realize you can delegate other normal people.
For example, Qaflana has 3 delegates.
Whenever 1 can't show up, the next one could help.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Most people have a job, day shift is usually 9-5, and night shift has to sleep for the day. Having meetings really early or really late, makes it difficult for member nations to participate.
Should 1 not be able to join, it is not at all guaranteed that anyone else will be available.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Which is why we have timezone polls, to help decrease the chance of that happening.
That is also why CA is lenient on people missing a meeting.
But if it becomes a trait we are going to notice you are not active.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Do you notify nations that their representative is absent?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No, because everyone gets a ping to go to the session hall.
If you are online you should already be going.
Even if another rep is there.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This has been done when it becomes problematic. We have issued warnings to several nations over the past few months.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I was not aware of this.
If nations do not know that their representatives are absent, how are they supposed to solve the problem?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That is just an what-if.
They would know like how sertor said how the nations get warned.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Mr. Speaker I believe we should move on and move this conversation to another venue.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I agree with Mr. Ross.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Wrong channel for an argument, it got off topic.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This is an unproductive conversation.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It is.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Anyone want to add anything, we will be concluding today's session.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nothing from maple.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, then I will adjourn this meeting.
Please tell me how I did in a seperate venue.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let's get started.
Oh, also Australis is present.
First up on tonight's agenda is about reforming the Cupertino Alliance server.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I will not be available for a bit as I am about to embark on a trip of sorts. I shall go over this session later, or worse case scenario in the member pubs.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
From what I can gather from context, this is about making changes to the layout of the Alliance server. Does anybody have any thoughts, ideas or plans for this?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I’ve thought about some reorganization and deletion of completely inactive channels. I’ve been considering putting nation roles in alphabetical order, but that’s something so minor I’m not sure if that feedback is helpful. 
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That would make sense.
Among other people's suggestions and ideas.
A lot of unused channels have been archived, and the nation role alphabetization sounds good.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
specifically.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm unsure if that has a role in early culture of the Alliance, but I agree with you.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I suppose deleting such channels would be something I would have to collaborate with higher ministers and former ministers, just to make sure I don’t delete something important.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That sounds like a wise idea.
Is there any further discussion on this topic?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Before we continue, I am slightly concerned about the fact that we my not have quorum.
There is the speaker, one member, and two members supposedly temporarily present.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
That is a fair concern. I intended to reference the charter for this, but perhaps due to the fact that I woke up 5 minutes before the session, I can’t seem to find the charter.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I feel that it may be wise to reschedule this session as a result of low activity.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This session will be put to a recess until a new time has been set. I may not be able to host it, depending on times. We will see.

Alright we should have enough for a session.
Welcome and thank you to everyone for attending today's session.
We have a fair amount to discuss today, so I'll just post the agenda and we'll get started: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MXho4PA0_W7xLr3DjFq9MXwIRxOP64ncE6_00sbHLOY/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1MXho4PA0_W7xLr3DjFq9MXwIRxOP64ncE6_00sbHLOY/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Anybody wish to add anything before we get started?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
69 is funny and nothing more.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't believe that was necessary at all.
Otherwise we shall start with the creation of social media accounts.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
None
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
I have nothing to add.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The current plan is to create social media accounts which we can use for advertising and updating the general community with announcements or news.
I think that the main sites we should use are:
Anybody wish to add anything? The floor is open to discussion.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Facebook?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Facebook could work.
How big is the facebook community though?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I think Facebook would work more than Instagram, however both could work.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Why Youtube?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Rather large.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I dislike facebook, but whatever.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I know that the twitter community is rather large but you don't really hear much from facebook.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
I believe you can sync Facebook and Instagram accounts, so if you post an image on Instagram, it gets posted to Facebook as well.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="Aen&#246;pia#7843">@Logan Ross - Aenopia</span>
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think Instagram is a better candidate than Facebook.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Why Youtube?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
How so?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm referring to the fb micronational community.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
We can have more than one social media account for the alliance
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
But how many are micronation users that actively check?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">We can have more than one social media account for the alliance
By the way this will be handled by the Minister of Public Affairs.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I mean I could say the same about Instagram.
I know Adammia has a few followers on Facebook.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I know I, and many others use Instagram more. I believe that Instagram is way more popular with the younger generation than Facebook.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I know Adammia has a few followers on Facebook.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
For example, I use facebook for talking to my family, while instagram I use to check my college organization and my friends.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I would be against instagram for release of public information. It is more for releasing photos from what I understand.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Not really, let me pull up an example.
You are able to use it to convey information to people.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
There is a sizable micronational platform though and can increase publicity
I personally believe in the more the merrier for social media
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The thing is that instagram could be a useful means to spread the good word about the CA through interesting infographics, images, ect.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is no longer present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Noted.
Unless anyone wishes to add anything further shall we move on?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Noted.
Unless anyone wishes to add anything else we'll move on.
Next up we have discussion regarding the Cupertino Area of Natural Interest, or CAoNI.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
What is that?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I can confirm that planning between myself, David Augustus and Cole Baird has begun and will start to pick up over the next few days.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
An inactive program used to preserve nature and such.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">What is that?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Inactive program?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I hope to open up a form within the next few days for sign-ups for the first round in order to build momentum and gauge the popularity of the project.
The floor is open to discussion.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
If the legaslation has been passed, the Executive should have the right to propose such things.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Inactive program, a program uses legislation, should the power to establish parks not be given to the executive?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
No because that's not how the project will work?
Programs don't use legislation and there isn't an executive with our programs.
Have you seen the GUM Sister City program?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
No
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/GUM_Sister_Cities_Program">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/GUM_Sister_Cities_Program</a>
GUM Sister Cities Program</div>
The GUM Sister Cities Program is an ongoing program within the Grand Unified Micronational with the idea of relating cities of member states together to improve relations between nations just like their macronational counterparts. Started by Nicholas Randouler on 17 January 2020 as part of a test for a potential project following the same intent...</div>
Essentially it will run in a similar way to this.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I beg your pardon, I am unaccustomed to this system.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
No worries.
Anybody wish to add anything further to this?
Any suggestions will be more than welcome.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I have nothing to add to this.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
None here.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then moving on.
Next up we have session times.
As you may have seen recently we have been running a poll in order to establish the right times for meetings.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Point of order.
Did we not already have a Twin Towns program set up in the Spring of 2020?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A) I don't think I've ever heard of the Twin Towns program
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DgWBmKkMrQpmzKtj4cLwqRXFwJfYLz9ij_dQuCW7esw/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1DgWBmKkMrQpmzKtj4cLwqRXFwJfYLz9ij_dQuCW7esw/edit</a>

I believe it was proposed externally by Ivan, and discussed in-session.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's a rather interesting find actually.
I think that it would be more worthwhile to just stick to the CAoNI plan rather than splitting it into two projects and potentially be attacked by GUM members for copying the GUM Sister Cities program.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright we shall continue then.
Continuing with the session time discussion, unfortunately we had far fewer applications than we expected especially from European and Asian members.
Regardless though a majority of people said that Friday and Saturday was the best time for them to attend a session, with 1700 - 1800 being the time that best suited them.
Because of this, future American sessions shall be hosted on Friday at 1700.
Any objections to this?
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Next up I understand that this will be a controversial idea however I propose that we temporarily suspend Asian sessions for a few weeks and I shall explain why.
For while the Asian sessions are very important to the CA, I don't believe that we can currently justify hosting a session for 3 members.
Of course my grand plan is to continue the healthy growth of the Asian group however I feel as if our resources would be put to better use if we instead hosted a 3rd extra session which can act as a backup for the next few weeks until our member count grows.
The floor is open to discussion.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wholeheartedly reject this idea.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
May I ask, who are the three Asian states?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Lurdentania, Huai Sao and Australis as far as I'm aware.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Is Matthewopia a part of the alliance
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr. McPhail, is this relevant?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
My thinking was if we instead used the allocated slot for 2ish sessions which can be used as a general session until the asian sector grows - last session was cut short due to a lack of participation and I feel if we instead moved this time around for 2ish sessions until we can gain a few more members not only can we:
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I mean, they are a micronation in Australia. Which means they would make our member count 4z
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Of course the sessions would be reinstated once we hit 5-6 members.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
You want to increase participation from people unable to attend sessions, by selling out 2 continents?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
While I do agree there is not alot of nations in the asian section, even with Huai Sao being inactive, I feel like it leads back to just alienation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yeah I think I agree with you actually.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is no longer present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Weren’t you already not present?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I should note that the Grand Unified Micronational is now pushing forward with their Asian Representation and Sessions. 
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Shall we move on then?
Moving on we have the Cupertino Awards Assembly.
For those who don't know, this proposal intends to create a session which is solely dedicated to handing out development awards to our member states in order to encourage activity.
This would include the Lycon Cross.
The floor is open.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I am for such a session.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe this is a great idea, though we should refrain from this becoming a copy of the GUM Development Awards
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I support it as well
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What awards does the alliance currently have?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Lycon Cross, the Citizen Award, and the Delegate Award.
The latter two have been badly neglected.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Maybe we could exam and that, but that could come later.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Not forgetting the fact that there would also be new awards for development.
<div class="quote">The latter two have been badly neglected.
Based on the lack of discussion I feel like this is a good place to move on.
Next up we have the downgrading of inactive members to observer status.
From what I have noted so far, the only 3 inactive members are Georgensteine, Huai Sao and West River.
The floor is open.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Have they been notified of their inactivity?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Have any attempts been made to reach out to these delegations?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's why we're discussing it now.
Of course we won't downgrade them immediately after this session however we will be giving them a 2 week grace period with contact following the 3rd session.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It would have probably been more polite for either the Chair, or a staff member delegated the duty to privately reach out to main delegates, to find out what is going on.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
In hindsight I should have contacted the delegation before the motion was proposed.
I will be contacting them all after this session.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur, this discussion may be irrelevant. If they knew about it, they may be able to fix it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Does anyone wish to add anything regarding these nations?
Right we shall move onto everyone's favourite part of the meeting - applications.
James B. - Desert District: 
I apologize for my absence. Desert District will be intermittently present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
First up we have State of Vishwamitra 
State of Vishwamitra</div>

James B. - Desert District: 
But will the individual we all know I’m referring to be permitted as a delegate?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Not until he can be cleared.
That's why he will have to provide an alternative delegate.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would fully support the return of Vishwamitra.
If I am not mistaken, you are waiting on word from Mr. Sullivan?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Without delving too far into the topic, numerous delegates have stated their distaste against the readmission of said delegate.
LamentTwice: 
Mr. Stefan is a very professional micronationalist and would fit to be the Vishwamitran delegate.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Despite the fact that a similar organisation cleared them as well.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Mr. Stefan is a very professional micronationalist and would fit to be the Vishwamitran delegate.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is partially present
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark is present briefly.
Monmark is no longer present.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I fully support Vishwamitra
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I can attest that very few of these complainants were involved in the initial investigation, so unless someone has been leaking very personal information, this is likely the result of hearsay as opposed to empirical findings.
cameron: 
Australis fully supports Vishwamitra
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">That said, it is perhaps in best interests to open this investigation as whether they are admitted or not, some of the delegates involved in the initial review are dissatisfied with the outcome, and feel it was not handled very well.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Other than that shall we move on?
Plushunia 
Plushunia</div>

I'm going to have to abstain on this application.
Apparently they had an NSFW channel on their server.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I support Vishwamitra's applciation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We're talking about Cimbrun's application though.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I support Plushunia's application as well.
As for Cimbrun, I don't know much about them.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to discuss the current application.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I am going to have to say no, moreover for the lack of information and the nsfw channel.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Having an nsfw channel in an organisation full of minors is a big no for me.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I will say no as well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anyone else wish to add anything?
Moving on we have the Duchy of Ponchartrain-Maurepas
Duchy of Pontunia</div>
Pontunia, officially the Duchy of Pontchartrain-Maurepas, is an independent micronation that amicably seceded from the Austenasian Crown Dependency of New Pontunia in February 2021. It is comprised of various residential properties and two public parks declared independent from Metairie, Louisiana under the leadership of Duke Andrew I.</div>
Definite no from me.
Final ping for this evening.
brooke &#128158;:

I thoroughly concur.

Shall we call a temporary recess?

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I believe we should start off with “Motive micropatriology”
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Pinelandia is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We have a guest speaker, Ives.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
What exactly is motive micropatriology?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I actually don't know.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It aims to broaden the terms of simulationism and successionism
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm changing the settings to let Ives speak and then we should be good to go.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
This seems like an intriguing idea, but what would be the practical application for the CA?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Should be sorted now.
Good evening.
semiotic.waters: 
Hi <img loading="lazy" class="emoji " alt="👋" title="wave" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f44b.svg">
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Good day
semiotic.waters: 
I believe I'm here to answer questions on motive micropatriology
I have a graphic that explains it
If anyone wants more details - that's why I'm here
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Seems like an interesting idea but some CA members are questioning how would this relate to the CA
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Hmm
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, this seems more broad, not relating much to CA.
semiotic.waters: 
I'm hoping it can be an 'alliance' (as it were) that benefits both sides. The CA will strengthen its reputation for being at the forefront of new ideas and positive movements in the community; motive micropatriology will have a foothold that will stop it just being forgotten about in two weeks.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is present.
In my opinion, this is completely irrelevant to a CA session.
semiotic.waters: 
Practically, it would also impact your wiki-building programme, as you could encourage your member states to include in their wiki articles whether they're ludic-achievement, ludic-hobby, etc.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We could discuss this outside of a session.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This can also be intergrated with other projects like the CuperChat project, etc.
semiotic.waters: 
The reason this is being discussed in a session is that I'm asking the CA to consider officially endorsing it. As far as I understand it, that would require the session hall to vote to endorse it
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
What would be the point?
semiotic.waters: 
Something me and Jayden have discussed is that - if the CA endorses motive micropatriology - the main way that I would teach people about it is via helping the CA make CuperChat videos on the topic and sharing those through the community
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
This is just unnecessary.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
If the alliance picks up this deal then it would benefit both parties- there would be minimal downsides to this deal
semiotic.waters: 
The CA being associated with encouraging the use of motive micropatriology - e.g. people first learning about it via CuperChat videos; CA members being the first to use it on their wiki articles - would strengthen its reputation for being at the forefront of cool new ideas that benefit the community
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The alliance has all been about innovation and this is a pretty innovative idea
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">If the alliance picks up this deal then it would benefit both parties- there would be minimal downsides to this deal
semiotic.waters: 
That's why I brought it to you guys
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I see that but I don't think we need a whole guest speaker for voting on a politcal spectrum chart in replacement of 2 words.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I see no reason why we shouldn't endorse it - it's completely up to our members to use it within their nation and it isn't exactly a time-consuming project like CAoNI.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
It just seems like a way for the CA to become more relevant.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yeah but it gives more legitimacy for the author to come speak here
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That would be a good thing?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I strongly concur.
semiotic.waters: 
I was invited by Logan to help people understand what motive micropatriology is. I didn't actually ask to speak here
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
It just seems desperate.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Tesforia is semi present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Same argument can be said with acclaimed projects like the electoral graphics and Factbook?
semiotic.waters: 
I don't think it seems desperate for an organisation to endorse a new concept for the community?
Obviously I would think that
But still. Desperate seems like an odd word
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Those serve a purpose.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
It’s an interesting topic, though I don’t see how it relates to the CA.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Yeah but it gives more legitimacy for the author to come speak here
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Endorsing 4 words instead of 2 just is not the business of the CA.
semiotic.waters: 
CuperChat videos explaining it; member states using terms like ludic-achievement on their wiki pages; the organisation as a brand showing its interest in new ideas that benefit the community
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Those 2 words have been overtly vague- this project is to broaden the term, thus decreasing the conflict
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I still don't see how this is session-worthy, even just to answer questions.
semiotic.waters: 
I'm mostly here to explain the ideas. I don't want to get involved in CA politics.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
I think the concept provided by Mr. Blackwood is very interesting, but from a personal perspective, I haven't had many problems in describing Pinelandia or other micronational projects I'm involved with as simulationist. It's true the graph provided aims to depict a more comprehensive view on micropathiology, but I don't think it'd be appropriate to depict it as a replacement for simulationism and secessionism.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Simulationism can mean different things now.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
How do we know that this project will even last? All of the other micropatriological projects made but Mr. Blackwood have seemed to have died, how do we know that this one won't?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
He wrote a 5 page introduction to it, the same argument can be made with the Alliance in March 2020, there has already been some attention given to the idea.
semiotic.waters: 
If I may answer this: 'simulationism' and 'secessionism' are words that mean different things to different people; though you may not have been criticised for being simulationist, others have been, and the terms aren't perceived by everyone as neutral and unbiased; and they mix up descriptions of what a nation ultimately aims to do with descriptions of a nation's day to day activities
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Also, is Mr. Blackwood even allowed to speak here under the Charter?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="Aen&#246;pia#7843">@Logan Ross - Aenopia</span>
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Similar to the concepts of realism and liberalism in inter-macronational relations, these two concepts -- simulationism vs. secessionism and motive micropathiology -- could exist side by side, without the need to promote one over the other. I argue this because there are some in the micronational community (myself included) who prefer using the traditional simulationist and secessionist outlook on micronationalism, while others might prefer the new format proposed by Mr. Blackwood.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There is precedent for guests speaking in the session hall, as noted with Ivan and the Twin Town/Sister City project.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Also, is Mr. Blackwood even allowed to speak here under the Charter?
semiotic.waters: 
True - but naturally I think the CA should endorse one over the other, because I think motive micropatriology is better (:
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Also Mr. Speaker I think that we should begin wrapping this up before we end up drifting too far off schedule.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes we shall.
Is everyone wrapped up?
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Indeed, you're correct in saying that there's much ambiguity between those two terms, which has unfortunately resulted in some confusion. But at the most basic level, I've always interpreted simulationist micronations as those who do not wish to become independent of the macronation they're based out of, while secessionists do.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Was it only this topic on the agenda Mr. Speaker?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This was on the agenda.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We have a few more items and an application.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yeah, but it has decreased to the terms of simulationism being inmature whilst the other being more mature in the community
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

semiotic.waters: 
I can provide you with evidence that this is not the majority view if you wish, but I think that's beyond the scope of my appearance here
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright let's wrap this up before we get out of hand.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
, as I am making a curry at present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Let's move onto the next discussion.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you Mr. Blackwood for speaking this evening.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
semiotic.waters: 
Thanks for having me (:
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Thank you for proposing this interesting topic.
Our next topic will be about the Charter committee.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Thank you for speaking!
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I must leave the session. There is currently a power outage (across much of the state, I think), and therefore my Internet connection is shoddy and I would like to conserve my phone's battery.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Sure.
Sorry if I am a bit slow this meeting, I'm multitasking 4 things.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Charter was made back in June 2020 when the alliance was in a smaller state. At the time, it did the job. We finally had a codified constitution of some sort, but the alliance has grown exponentially the next few months, thus it is time to renew our charter.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I cede.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur with the honorable delegate from Qaflana.
The Charter is to simplify it, very outdated.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
I must quickly add that work on a new charter involving the committee will be beginning at the turn of next week.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Whilst we had been focusing on reviving projects the past few months, this is nearly finished. I ask the alliance to take on the next chapter, and thus join <span class="mention">#charter-discussion</span>.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Delegates who are interested in aiding us in creating the new charter should request the role in an appropriate venue.
I cede the floor.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur, I believe we are close to a revitalization of the charter.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I concur as well.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Anything else to add?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Nay.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Nothing here.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I agree with the idea of revising the Charter.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, we are moving on.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
I have nothing to add.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Now our next topic the removal of inactive states.
I feel like this should be worked on immediately work on this.
Have you gotten in contact with any of the states?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I have indeed contacted West River, Huai Siao and Georgensteine.
Apparently I contacted the wrong delegate of Georgenstiene however I presume that they would have forwarded the warning to their primary delegate.
Huai Siao has apologised and stated that they wish to become more active.
I haven't heard back from West River yet.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Huai Siao has shown initiative and has posted a delegate application
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
When have you contacted West River?
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Like what day. <span class="mention" title="Aen&#246;pia#7843">@Logan Ross - Aenopia</span>
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yesterday morning apparently.
This was early in the morning though.
However even then I would have presumed that they would have contacted back in the past 36hrs.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They had supple time.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I admit that I messaged them a little later than I planned.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I am glad Huai Sao is showing initiative.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Georgensteine hasn't done anything yet though right?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Georgensteine hasn't done anything yet though right?
But even then I can only hope that they've showed some initiative by forwarding this to their primary delegate.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, atleast.
Anything else to add?
Moving on.
Our next topic is the Application Veto Act.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qnV1vUDnOAex0AUXvba5oXj9HlLEJuByg6O7BOKVQ1Q/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qnV1vUDnOAex0AUXvba5oXj9HlLEJuByg6O7BOKVQ1Q/edit?usp=sharing</a>

We were discussing this during an earlier session.
SuperGuy1119: 
I request the floor.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I cede the floor to Raphael.
SuperGuy1119: 
I have a question for the chair.
I was wondering if delegates could be added as sponsors for pieces of legislation.
Not authors, sponsors.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Do you think you could elaborate on this?
SuperGuy1119: 
There’s the name of a piece of legislation’s author and under that, there are the act or bill’s sponsors.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It isn't a de jure rule but you could concur and that would fulfill sponsorship.
SuperGuy1119: 
Prominent people who support the bill.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The name is for the author for citation though.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Surely it would be easier to concur with the bill in the session?
SuperGuy1119: 
I believe I have my answer.
I yield the floor.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Noted.
I concur with this Act.
It makes the process easier for denying nations.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that if a delegate does not agree with a rejection then they can always bring it up in the session.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This act broadens the justifications listed in the Executive Rejection Act so it seems
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
There was an executive rejection act this entire time?
We should have used it more often.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes but it could really only be used for nations below 2 months in age
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It doesn't account for things like reputation and all.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The overall goal for this act is to speed up the application process by rejecting nations that would be universally deemed as unacceptable for membership.
James B. - Desert District: 
I support this act.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">It doesn't account for things like reputation and all.
For example we would executively reject Almendria or another nation of the likes for unprofessional behaviour.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Under the previous act we couldn't reject Almendria due to it being older than 2 months
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Which in my opinion makes this act even more important.
Also I believe that we should start looking at moving on, Mr. Speaker.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, do we have any further motions we wish to discuss?
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">If not lets move onto applications. <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(94, 197, 171); background-color: rgba(94, 197, 171, 0.1);">@Members</span>
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We only have 1 state to discuss.
State of Vishwamitra

Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur as well.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They are a perfect fit for here.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I also concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That's our third reading, we can vote on them now.
Is that all this session?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I shall put it to a vote this evening.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I cede the floor to Jayden.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Relating to the Noted project, it was planned to be sent to Humberlea next but considering the current political climate, this is pending. Should we send it to Lokin or to Georgienstine or directly to Australis?
I yield
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Out of the 3 nations the only nation that we can be certain on the membership of is Australis.
Speaking about Lokin I will be announcing his suspension later.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think we should send it directly to Australis.
Atleast to be safe.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
If that is all this session I shall conclude this session.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Productive session, good job to everyone
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Thank you everyone for showing up.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you Mr. Speaker for your work tonight.

Alright it is now 3:00 AM UTC, we shall commence with the 68th session, for reference this is the agenda: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZBpAQi8SkD3vWObcFA3WUMA6fks1ztjXq6GotL70A20/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZBpAQi8SkD3vWObcFA3WUMA6fks1ztjXq6GotL70A20/edit?usp=sharing</a>

First up on the agenda we have the Application Commissioners Act, give me a moment to pull that up.
I seem to have not been sent such an act nor can I find it, in that case I will move on and hopefully come back to this piece on the agenda, unless if anyone here would have any information on this Act.
Next on the agenda we have the second reading of the Chair Veto Act, does anyone have any thoughts on this bill: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qnV1vUDnOAex0AUXvba5oXj9HlLEJuByg6O7BOKVQ1Q/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qnV1vUDnOAex0AUXvba5oXj9HlLEJuByg6O7BOKVQ1Q/edit</a>

James B. - Desert District: 
I support this.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It is not finished.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I do not.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I am opposed to this Act.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
It gives them too much power.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If it was finished it would support it.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Hear hear
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I do not support this act. It seems to be unfinished and unfair too.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Indeed
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I believe that all member applications should be given a fair chance.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Indeed, even if it is a disgraced nation
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
This Act can be easily used by a Chair with bad intent, to dismiss a nation they just don't like.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I do agree, as this power could possibly be abused by the Chair or the Superior Judge
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
I abstain from accepting or rejecting the act.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Parliament can overturn the veto right?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Well, I believe in accountability and this is no where near the standards of democratic bureaucracy I am comfortable with.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I oppose the act.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I actually am going to abstain.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This bill should not have moved to a reading, it is clearly rushed and unfinished.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Delegates may object to rejections in a formal session or by alerting the Chair of the Board or Superior Judge, Though there is this clause that I believe can contest a nation rejection.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur with the Hon. Delegate from Maple.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Are there any further comments on this bill?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Again, rushed and unclear.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I once again concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
As do I.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This bill should have been referred to committee or should have waited for another session.
With that, no further comment.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Noted, I will bring these complaints to the author of the bill.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
What committee?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Any final comments before I move on?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
A Legislative, Parliamentary or Legislative committee, or the closest thing in this organisation.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
None from me.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
None here.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
None from myself.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
None.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Alright then, the next item on this agenda is the Nomination and appointment of Deputy Regional Ministers, does anyone have any thoughts on this?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I am not familiar with the members being nominated.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
This agenda item is a bit vague, and I do not believe I was sent any further information on this.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Anyone have anything to say?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
That's quite unfortunate that we cannot discuss this topic as well.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Indubitably.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Anyways, I guess we shall move on from this topic then. Does anyone have any further motions before we move onto membership applications?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
None from maple.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
None from me.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I do.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Oh?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
You have the floor Mr. Montan
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Thank you.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Welcome
Woland - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Today, it has come to my attention that one of our member states, the Duchy of Pontchartrain-Maurepas, may no longer hold its own sovereignty, but rather it may be a non-sovereign dominion within Fesmar, another well-known micronation.
I believe that we shall investigate if these allegations are true, and if they are, Pontunia should have its membership revoked.
I cede the floor, Mr. Speaker.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
May I comment on this situation?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Go ahead Mr. Munroe
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Thank you Mr. Lt. Chair. 
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I learned of the information through the Gayverian Discord server, but I do not think it was because of the ongoing conflict.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
If possible, could you Mr. Montan send a bit of proof of Pontunia becoming a dominion of Fesmar?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Also, for the record, the conflict between Gayveria and Ausveria is completely satirical.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Do we not have representatives or diplomats in the nation?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes, one second.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
We do.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I have heard nor seen any information regarding Pontunia becoming a dominion of Fesmar.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Are they not aware of the situation of the nation?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Here is how I learned of Pontunia possibly becoming part of Fesmar.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I'm not sure if they are available at the moment
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I do not think this is sufficient proof to say that Pontunia is a dominion of Fesmar.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I must concur. Following on from Mr. Montan, this will need to be investigated to authenticate these allegations.
Woland - Desert District: 
Would this not be a more efficient process if we just pinged them to ask?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Thank you Mr. Montan, if you had shown that in the first place or alongside the first screenshot it would have sufficed.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Can we not contact their heads of states?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
is present.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I concur with the Desert District.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I have noticed that there is an issue with the permissions in this channel. I will be fixing these shortly, and if any members have lost their permissions to speak here, it is not done with malicious intent, and the permissions will be restored shortly after.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I did not see the image until after I posted the screenshot that I took. There is no need for passive-aggressiveness.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
There was no passive-aggressiveness included in that message. It was an honest misunderstanding, I had not seen the image posted by the delegate for Burdette in the informal member's chat.
It is difficult to convey emotion and tone over text, even more so in a formal situation where one cannot use visual aids to express emotions.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
We understand, Mr. Munroe
Anyways, going back to the subject, I believe we should save this discussion on Pontunian sovereignty for the next session or whenever their head delegate is present to give insight into the current situation within their nation.
But, does anyone have any further comments?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
None.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I make a comment on an earlier topic?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Go ahead
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
&#167;2B of the Chair Veto Act is clearly unfinished. The act needs to be fixed, as opposed to submitting half-finished bills to Parliament.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Noted.
I believe it is now appropriate to move onto the last section of this session on membership applications.
First up on the list of applicants is the Revalian Kingdom
<a href="https://discord.gg/3dNXBjGy">https://discord.gg/3dNXBjGy</a>
Revalian Kingdom</div>
The Revalian Kingdom, often referred to as Revalia, is a sovereign state located in the Harju region of Estonia. The nation’s head of state is Regent Sander I.</div>
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Where are the remarks?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Would have them by any chance?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I do not.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I myself was not sent them before this session
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark is present.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I was given short notice on the drafting of the remarks, and could not get around to them.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe there is sufficient information to judge this nation via their microwiki page though
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I oppose the Revalian Kingdom's admission to the alliance on the grounds that one of their representatives is underage.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
With all due respect, without the remarks.. it would be unfair to process membership applications without the proper information.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
On that note, after this application is reviewed, could I propose something to the floor that is not necessarily a membership application, but is related to them?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe this should be suspended and brought forth to the next session.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
That would be fine.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I strongly agree.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Thank you.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Alright then, I will inform the Chair of my decision to postpone the readings of these membership applications then.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
I believe in future, the cabinet should better coordinate and communicate with each other to prevent such a re-occurance.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I must concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur as well.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I strongly agree.
Additionally information ought to be made available first in the informal chat, and only once confirmed should it be made available to this body.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Duly noted, I understand your frustrations with the inconsistency with the quality of this session and I will likely focus more of my already allotted time to this organization if this miscommunication were to continue.
You have the floor to bring forth your proposition.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker.
I do not yet have an Act to codify this idea, but my proposal is the discontinuation of remarks of nations that already have a page on MicroWiki or somewhere similar.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I disagree.
James B. - Desert District: 
I disagree as well.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I must oppose such a proposal.
James B. - Desert District: 
A MicroWiki is not guaranteed honesty and can be of low quality.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Given that we have postponed membership applications due to a lack of remarks, I would have to disagree as well.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I must concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Remarks are mostly just MicroWiki pages restated into a few different boxes on a Google Doc, and always have been. Removing these remarks will give the Ministry of Membership Attainment lots of more time to work on more important things, such as community outreach.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
A micro wiki is information, that is Unreliable and remarks allow us to understand the nation and their reasoning behind applying better than any wiki.
James B. - Desert District: 
This would give less information to applicants on voting and frankly I find it concerning you are trying to seemingly get out of your main job in your current position.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Remarks are sourced from MicroWiki. That is a problem that we always will have, and removing a second layer on top of the MicroWiki page will no nothing in that regard.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Remarks are an essential part of the process to considering the outcome of an applicant nation. As with what Jamez has said, this would practically nullify your position.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Is there any law forcing us to take them from a wiki?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It's extremely difficult to find information otherwise
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is it not one of the cabinets goals to expand the remark system and to in fact co-operate with the Grand Unified Micronational and share such documents?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
The remarks.
The wiki link is still available should a nation have them.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I feel that my main job of writing remarks is redundant and unnecessary. If the Ministry that I run could shift its job to more important work that grows our Alliance, instead of being a buffer to new states joining, we could become an even greater Alliance.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
The alliance does t need to grow.
It needs to be active.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I concur.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
If the concern for these remarks is the time, I believe it could be beneficial to outreach to willing members to prepare remarks, as I remember when Jayden would use to outsource this work to willing delegates.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
That's kind of the whole point of your ministry.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I would be willing to write several remarks if it helps.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Remarks have nothing to do with activity.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
No they don’t c
But your ministry isn’t exactly the busiest already
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is it not the case that you can outsource the remark writing to anonymous individuals? I know for a fact that has happened during the 2nd Parliament (Though I do not believe I can legally name the authors).
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
And not every nation has a wiki page. Plus, you could just ask the applicant to tell you more about their nation.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
And there is no need to shift your duty to getting more and more members.
You are fixing a problem that doesn’t exist for another problem that doesn’t exist.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Right now, yes. However, things are able to change, and I think the Ministry of Membership Attainment should focus on other subjects regarding membership attainment, such as discussions with prospective members on whether the CA is right for them.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Or at least they are not as dire as you seem to imply they are.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I have had an application for that job out for almost two months. I have since hired only one person, the only person who was interested at all, and that person has not written the remarks the one time I asked them, as I was busy.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes, I know. The proposal does not entirely get rid of remarks, but solely gets rid of remarks for nations that have pages on MicroWiki.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
If possible could I sign up for such a job?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Microwiki is unreliable.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Please contact me privately about the matter.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Back when Monmark first applied, our wiki page was to put it bluntly, bad. I see no reason to base judgements off of things such as a more than likely unreliable wiki article.
brooke &#128158;: 
Peff Jontus
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I will say this again. Remarks are mostly based off of MicroWiki pages. Removing the barrier of the remark for the vast majority of applications will free up the Ministry to do lots of more important work.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Thank you, Ms. Kennedy.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
If I may be excused a tad.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Monmark is no longer present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Although that was quite funny, Ms. Kennedy, I think it is appropriate to delete it from this venue.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Are there any further comments on this matter?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
None
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
When I was requested to write the remarks that I could not get to earlier today for this session, I was only provided with MicroWiki pages.
I cede the floor, Mr. Speaker.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Thank you, Mr. Montan.
propose such a measure in a bill format so delegates can properly vote on your proposition.
Does anyone else have any final motions before I adjourn this session?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I will draft an Act soon.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Noted, I hereby adjourn this session at 4:05 AM UTC.
This was a fairly productive session, unfortunately there were several items we were not able to cover due to a lack of materials provided, anyways thank you for attending.

Ponderosa Hills is intermittently present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright we should have enough members for a session.
Good evening to everyone and thank you for attending tonight's session.
Here is tonight's agenda if you haven't seen it already: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/15gCo-nMsdEf11YjvTJeFxOpNh-mFF8rRDHq-wWR7E5Y/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/15gCo-nMsdEf11YjvTJeFxOpNh-mFF8rRDHq-wWR7E5Y/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Now I understand that this is the 69th session and the connotations revolving around the aforementioned number, however I must make it clear that any breaches of decorum this evening will result in access to this channel being removed for the individuals involved.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I was talking about the agenda.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Pinelandia is present.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I thought the agenda was nice.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
My apologies.
Anybody have anything they wish to state before we begin?
Alright then, we'll start with the Chair Veto Act.

I have taken some of the comments and suggestions from the last session made by delegates regarding the act, and have since decided to improve on the act.
The floor is open to discussion.
Personally I believe that we should set firmer rules for rejection, considering the fact that previous abilities for rejection were fairly lacklustre.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I am still in opposition to this Act.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody else wish to add anything else?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
None here.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall move on.
Recently it has been brought to my attention that the sovereignty of Pontunia has become a bit clouded, with some people believing that they have joined another nation.
As far as I'm aware they have joined a commonwealth however I believe that we should assess whether or not their sovereignty and subsequent status in the Cupertino Alliance has been infringed.
If they are indeed a member of this commonwealth, then I believe that we should formally decide the line on how sovereign a nations should be in order to be considered as a member for future reference regarding members and applicants.
The floor is open.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
On the other hand there is this which suggests otherwise.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
This shows that Pontunia is not sovereign. As they are not a diplomatically independent entity, they should be expelled.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Muchnieg I - Hausgurd: 
I agree.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I believe that once a nation loses a major stake of their Government to a higher body such as another nation they are no longer sovereign.
Asher Young - Qaflana: 
I concur; furthermore, I do not think Pontunia should have been admitted in the first place.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If we had their primary delegate present in order to vouch for them, this discussion would have been better.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
On the topic of Pontunia, there is overwhelming evidence they are no longer a sovereign state. According to the charter, they are no longer eligible for membership.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Muchnieg I - Hausgurd: 
And they seem to be very disluganised into somesort of cult following
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There was a similar situation when Pontunia was undergoing the same antics under Austenasia.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Does anyone have the treaty (or equivalent) that made Pontunia part of the Fesmarian Commonwealth?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It may be on their server if anybody is on there.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Pontunia appears to no longer have sovereignty.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I conferred with Kenneth of Fesmar, and he stated he had no documentation of the treaty, and forwarded me to an 'Andrew'.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
'Andrew' is probably referring to the leader of Pontunia, who is named Andrew.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd presume so.
brooke &#128158;: 
The Pontunian government that reigns at present is illegitimate, anyways. The rat arch-reactionary Andrew ousted the legitimate proletarian government of the Pontunian People’s Democratic Socialist Republic by force. He derailed democracy and ushered the proud and sovereign Pontunian nation into Fesmarian imperialist occupation. They do not belong in these hallowed halls.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Does anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
brooke &#128158;: 
Pontunia should not be considered for the Cupertino Alliance until the true leader, Jeff Pontus, is returned to his rightful place as the guide of the Pontunian revolution.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
No comment.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I must also concur with this statement.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
That sounds like an almighty mess.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Moving on, we have an update regarding the CAoNI project.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
brooke &#128158;: 
For clarification for those of you who are unaware, I am in fact Jeff Pontus
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I also concur.
James B. - Desert District: 
I was gonna say Desert District is present.
But we already are.
brooke &#128158;: 
You can take over, sir.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
As you may have seen, I recently published a link to the CAoNI application form, which you may find here: <a href="https://forms.gle/bhFUomtcPvGEqj6bA">https://forms.gle/bhFUomtcPvGEqj6bA</a>
Google Forms - create and analyze surveys, for free.</div>
Create a new survey on your own or with others at the same time. Choose from a variety of survey types and analyze results in Google Forms. Free from Google.</div>
Then we'll begin to pair the CAoNIs with other nations.
The floor is open to discussion.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to make any statements before we move on?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe this program is well-made and wish it well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright, next we have the potential reintroduction of Applicant Commissioners.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is no longer present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
During the earlier months of the Cupertino Alliance we utilised Applicant Commissioners in order to survey applicant nations, especially their servers where applicable.
Because the requirement to have a Discord server has since been removed, the commissioners were apparently abolished.
Because we recently had an applicant who had touchy content within one of their servers, I feel like it would be appropriate to re-establish the role, even if it's just for reviewing discord servers.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe it would be a good resource to have applicant commissioners to be used as a tool by the Alliance.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Muchnieg I - Hausgurd: 
I agree with Matthew.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
which contains the servers of member states, I don't want to potentially expose minors to inappropriate content which may exist on the server of one of our member states.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur, all of our actions happen over discord, so I would imagine we would have it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This is definitely a worthy consideration.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It is quite a shame that the original role fell out of use, however I propose that we either:
Anybody wish to add anything else before we move on?
We shall move on then.
Unfortunately Mr. Roscoe is not present this evening to discuss his motion, so we shall move onto the applications.

Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
Plushunia is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They started in November.
5 months.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
From what I have heard their leader is 12, however, Sander Koff has claimed that they are 13 years old.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
September apparently.
My only issue is that their Prime Minister and King are the same guy.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Their MW page started in November, and it also states that in the remarks.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe I have heard reports that their delegate is underage as well.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
I'm not very happy about that either, but hopefully it's temporary.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Possibly underage, and that they are the same person.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Even if it is temporary, that does bring up issues with their development.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Probably going to be an abstain from me.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Burdette is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Way too immature.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
The MW page isn't when the nation was founded likely.

Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
I was about to say that.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I dont think that the King and Prime Minister being the same person should be criteria for rejection.
Lest there be sockpuppetry involved.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I think they do.

Yeah I somewhat agree
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.

Perhaps.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">The DRotUCE found that tarnova had many nazis, which Tarnova did not censor in any way. The DRotUCE did not like this, and tried to get the government to change this. It culminated in an operation in which a DRotUCEian spy was granted admin within Tarnova, and was supposed to use it to ban the nazis, and remove the related channels. The spy was unable to do this, and instead decided to remove all the channels and taunt the Tarnovans until the server owner came along and banned him. Tarnova proceded to rebuild, and relations with the DRotUCE soured.</div>
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I agree Matthew was the Prime Minister and Emperor of Yu-Xia for a time so it would be a little unfair to reject them for that.

Indeed we have.

Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
So they griefed a server?

Apparently so.

Nazis or not you shouldn’t do that.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Alleged Nazis...
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I don't understand why people do this kind of stuff because there are nazis on a server.
Just contact Discord support with their username and proof of their alleged behaviour.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I have spoken with someone from the DRotUCE and they told me that they nuked a server because there were Nazis on the server.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Definitely a no from me then.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yeah I don't really like how this nation is sounding currently, this is going to be a no from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They also sound so proud of ruining a server.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
Excuse me, but what is server nuking? I'm not very knowledgeable on such terms.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Ruining a server - like deleting all roles and channels.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
I see.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's the classic tactic of discord-based nations, usually those aligned with the Reddit sector.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It's quite immature behavior from this micronation.

I guess that happens when one does not set the permissions properly.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What was Wendatia, or at least their delegate expelled for previously?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's been such a long time that I can't remember.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I think it was due to their leader's choice of words.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe it may have been based on their conduct with another member of the community.
Regardless, they have improved themselves in the past few months, and I'd be willing to give them a chance as an observer.

Alright then, that is the end of this evening's session.
Thank you to everyone who has attended tonight's very productive session.

If we start right now, Vishwamitra could attend. 
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Let’s start now then.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As you wish, Mr. Chair.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hello and welcome to the 70th session of the Cupertino Aliance everyone!
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cf3ObhFk7rSaxUw8IUlAxOrjwvt4StdNCmmEKziY3K0/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1cf3ObhFk7rSaxUw8IUlAxOrjwvt4StdNCmmEKziY3K0/edit?usp=sharing</a>
70th session agenda</div>
70th session Agenda 3rd Parliament, 70th session American Auxiliary Session 24 March 2021 at 8PM UTC / 3PM EST    The following document is the official agenda and the associated resources of the 70th  Parliament session. The 70th session is a American Auxiliary Session scheduled to be hosted...</div>
Here is our agenda for the day.
So first we have a discussion about the reintroduction of Application Commissioners.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, go ahead.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
If the Chair or any delegate wishes, please provide me a backrgound for the said proposal?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
During the earlier months of the Cupertino Alliance we utilised Applicant Commissioners in order to survey applicant nations, especially their servers where applicable.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe a parliamentary discussion in this serves little to no purpose. This is entirely under the purview of the Ministry of Membership Attainment, and it is their responsibility as to whether these jobs are created oncemore.
I cede the floor.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Logan has not sent me anything based on this act, so I would have to concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with Hon. Mr. Valentinus. And feel that it is over bureaucracy.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Anyone else would like to talk about this act before we move on?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from our end.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright let's move on.
Next we have a proposal by Daniel.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Can we see it?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I have been sent nothing.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
So we move on then?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe that Hon. Mr. Daniel is asleep and also the contents in the agenda is to be declared.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I guess.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
So, we may move on.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If I may, I may know what the proposal is.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I can try and retrieve it by the sessions end.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright.
Now let's discuss the sovereignty of Pontunia.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This does however link back to the rampant breakdown in communication with the cabinet, prevalent even earlier in the last Asian Session.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, I agree. I only spoke to Logan once, and that was about me hosting today.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Chair, is there any supporting document regarding the proposal?
I mean what shall we discuss on their sovereignty?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well, mainly if anyone has any updates on them .
I'm trying to follow under the agenda Logan made.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There is nothing to discuss. There is overwhelming evidence they are a subdivision of Fesmar, and ineligible for membership as per the charter.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They now have legislation however.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does under any law, the Charter allow this organization to decide, discuss or recognize of the sovereignty of any nation?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
A legislature, you mean?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No, they have rights to legislation.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
When we say, Dominion, it is a tricky question.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
So does the state of New York.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
So do city and county councils. This does not define a sovereign state.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, I was about to say it isn't a full nation however.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The UK ceased to hold sovereignty over India with the implementation of the Independence Act, 1947 and it was a soveriegn nation.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Just a sub of Fesmar.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But India was a dominion under UK between 1947 and 1950 with King George VI being the King.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As noted by the chair in the previous session:
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur with that statement.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That is the personal thought of the Chair, we look into constitutional remarks and legal docs.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They no longer hold their rights however.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Several organs have been proven to now be under Fesmarian Control as the overarching state.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Just a subclass nation apart of Fesmar.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Did it specify what shall be status of the head of state in Pontunia?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There is also precedent for Pontunia doing the exact same, under the misrepresentation during their status as an Austenasian Town merely a month or two earlier.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Who is basially the head of state? the King of Fesmar or the Duke or whatever of Pontunia
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I must concur. There was a lengthy discussion in the Grand Unified Micronational
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They don't control there own foreign relations that should be enough.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
If we have evidential supporting documents that Pontunia is not an independent nation or does not have basic sovereignty rights, then I don't believe, it's fine to allow them here as an sovereign nation only because they have rights over defence and legislation
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Right. Foreign affairs is one of the very important factors and decides the sovereignty.
In my context with the example of India, the independent India despite being a dominion had control over all forms of external, internal, defence, telecommunications, etc matters.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Does anyone wish to add anything extra?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from I.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Logan is offline so we have to skip the GreenCities discussion.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Now let's discuss the expulsion of Georgienstine and West River.
To the best of my ability they haven't taken any action to show up to meetings.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Georgienstine was here on the 6th.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Are they being expelled on the same grounds on which Vishwamitra was expelled in November?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
A. Olivier last meeting was in late February, and Raphael was here on the 6th.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I believe that is better then a lot of nations.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Very inactive.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Nay.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It is not good considering Raphael went to 3/06, and then the meeting before that 1/02
And even on 1/02 he said he was present, and then said nothing after that.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They have attended a session recently. They should not be expelled on the grounds of not attending some last sessions.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Has anyone attempted to reach out to them?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Are they inactive as nations as well?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Logan has, but I don't think they made any action.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe if there has been no attempt or warning, it would be improper to expel them at this time.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We will have to contact Logan on that.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Moletopia hasn't attended a session since last year.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I'm just worried that they are going back to being inactive again.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Has Logan not informed you on the background on the agenda?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I think there are more inactive nations so I think it's a bit unfair to go only after these two.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Kind of just free running it with everyone.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with Hon. Mr. Burdette.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have contacted them recently. Today in fact.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Mr. Speaker, may I interupt?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
You may.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The Grand Duke, William Cooper is infact one of the active diplomats Vishwamitra has.
He is our Canadian Ambassador and we receive news very often from him.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I mean we do have to get better at session planning.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I propose that this session should be postponed and rescheduled to an appropriate time when the speaker is fully informed about the agenda. This is a disaster where we can only talk about things that are not written.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present, apologies for the timing.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with Hon. Mr. Liam Munroe.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Thank god.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The Speaker is not fully informed on the agenda.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This was supposed to have happened at 20:00 GMT, not UCT.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No?
<a href="https://floppa.bingus.host/%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8C%E2%80%8B">https://floppa.bingus.host/​‌‌‌​​‌‌​‌​​​‌‌‌​‌​‌​​​​​‌‌​​‌​​​‌​‌‌​​​​‌‌‌​​‌​​‌‌​​​​‌​‌‌‌​‌‌​</a>

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That would be my fault then.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It says both.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But GMT and UTC is same for me.
But it began an hour ago
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Regardless, shall we restart the session on a clean slate?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It began at 19.00 UTC for me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">But GMT and UTC is same for me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We have already moved a lot into the discussions.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Sure, we already did Discussion: Reintroduction of Application Commissioners and Discussion: Sovereignty of Pontunia 
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe we should proceed, and touch up on the missed subjects at the end.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Specifically Hamilton's proposal and GreenCities
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, shall we continue to membership section, or retouch on the subjects right now.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Regarding the proposal by Mr. Hamilton, I have heard nothing from him even though I asked him to either explain it for send me a link to the associated bill.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The agenda bears it as Roscoe, may be a mistake of the one who wrote it.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
He has been bit busy recently, I can confirm it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Daniel prefers to be called Hamilton.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
He has adopted a pseudonym for privacy reasons.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am well aware of that.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">The agenda bears it as Roscoe, may be a mistake of the one who wrote it.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I was referring that as the agenda is public; its better to change it.
Anyways, we must move on to the next on the agenda.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Until we receive anything from Mr. Hamilton regarding the act, it will be wiped from the agenda.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Let us keep all discussions of this matter private, and respect the name Hamilton.
Next we have GreenCities.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If I may?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Go ahead.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra will not speak on this topic.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As you may all be aware, we are currently entering into the warmer period of the year. Because of this, I believe that this is the perfect time to open up this year's applications for the Greencities project so to allow ample time for planting and growing. Of course the project consists of 2 parts:
I cede.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think this is a great plan.
I don't feel we have alot to discuss however.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Anything you wish to add?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that it would be useful to discuss fundraising techniques including the mooted fundraising session which I have proposed in the past.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well, I think Go Fund Me is a great one.
We could also set up a PayPal Pool.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That would be a good means of receiving the money but we need to figure out the event we would be conducting this under.
Should we go with an extra session? Fundraising an earth day cleanup? When should we host it?
Who would be in charge of planning?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We can do something like ludwig did.
<a href="https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/esports/ludwig-becomes-most-subbed-twitch-streamer-after-198-hour-stream/ar-BB1eRI7G?ocid=uxbndlbing">https://www.msn.com/en-us/sports/esports/ludwig-becomes-most-subbed-twitch-streamer-after-198-hour-stream/ar-BB1eRI7G?ocid=uxbndlbing</a>
Ludwig becomes most-subbed Twitch streamer after 198-hour stream</div>
Ludwig becomes most-subbed Twitch streamer after 198-hour stream</div>
Of course just a idea.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I must say I don't think any of us can stay up for 198 hours.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well, you don't have to be awake.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
We could pass the torch
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
^^
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
You want someone to film themselves sleeping?
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
We have members spanning many timezones
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
alright.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Would be creepy.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
The sun never sets on the Cupertino Alliance, to put it more poetically.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We need to do something that would get the MW community to donate.
It can't be just out of our pockets.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
24 hour MicroWiki editathon.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is intermittently present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is no longer present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If we do something like Ludwig then we could always follow what the GUM does with 24hr quorums and just let it go onwards.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Noted, seeya.
Ludwig gained 500k from the stream, of course we don't pull the same amount of people but I can imagine we get 100-200 dollars if we are good.
Anyone wish to add more to this topic?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think we should aim for at least &#163;40 to be reasonable.
Any extras can go to charity of course.
LamentTwice: 
I think we should strive for the longest session ever made.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I think we should stay realistic.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Might take a few weeks.
Actually longer then 3 months
LamentTwice: 
Not in terms of breaking a record.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If we host it in the next few months then we could potentially host it for ~50hrs.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
We would have to break the record to have the longest session ever made...
James B. - Desert District: 
48 hour Session?
LamentTwice: 
By CA standards.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">48 hour Session?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I believe we can do it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The key would be to have a semi-formal session punctuated with discussion.
Decorum staying the same of course.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Could part of it be trying to get the CA article to GA status?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If people want to assist in the planning of the session then please feel free to dm me.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Maybe 8 or so hours of MicroWiki stuff.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I guess we could.
Maybe aim for a group objective of 2000+ edits in 48 hours?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
How about we discuss this more in depth in our next session?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Sounds good to me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright now let's discuss member applications.
Revalian Kingdom
Revalian Kingdom</div>
The Revalian Kingdom, often referred to as Revalia, is a sovereign state located in the Harju region of Estonia. The nation’s head of state is Regent Sander I.</div>
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their page is sup-par, but workable.

It still <strong>greatly</strong> concerns me that the King and PM are the same person.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It doesn't really concern me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think it shows immaturity to me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd be willing to give them a chance as an observer to grow.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I am going to abstain.
James B. - Desert District: 
I concur with the Chair.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Maybe they're just waiting for someone to fill their place?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I to concur with the Chair even though I can not currently vote.
James B. - Desert District: 
That is possible.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We could just straight ask them.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
May as well if we're all curious about it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Like we just ask, Are you the same person as the PM?, and they can go indepth why or the lie.
Helps us either way.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Their leader might be under the age of 13.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
What makes you say that?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I remember hearing about that in the GUM server last month or so.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
.
Multiple reports.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
May I see these reports.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thanks for letting us know, maybe ask for them to appoint another delegate?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That should not be grounds to discourage an application at all.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Either that or it'll be a straight up no from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Still, why? Like I said we should just ask them.
Next we have Democratic Republic of the Unified Communist Empire

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their wiki page screams absolutely not.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Also based on past actions.
&gt; 
Still proud of nuking a server.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Again, absolutely not.
Nazis or not, you don't nuke servers.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Anything you wish to add?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They are fairly active on this server so they may be a good asset to the alliance.
Anybody had any experience of note with them?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I can't see anything bad that can't be fixed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Probably will be a support from me.

Same.

Finally we have Wendatia.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
From experience with their leader recently, they have definitely grown since their expulsion.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah they seem fine with me.
What did they do to get removed?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Was there leader suspended ever? I know there was some discussion about that in the last reading
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their leader wasn't suspended as far as I remember but their nation was expelled.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Oh my bad.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe a major factor in their expulsion was involvement in the Tungsten Pact.
I have just had a gander through past posts.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well speaking of recent, they seem to have matured greatly.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
They have definitely improved over the last few months.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
How so?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They seem to have become more professional by the looks of things.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Which things?
LamentTwice: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Which things?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Like which parts of Wendatia have become more professional?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their assets like their wiki page has definitely improved, and my experiences with their delegate have been mostly positive.
If they were a member of another organisation then it would be easier to judge them.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Anything to add before I end this meeting then?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well then I close out the 70th session of the Cupertino Alliance.

Warmedic - Monmark: 
The representative for maple is present, and awaiting normal order.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright we have enough members for a session.
Thank you to everyone who has taken the time to attend the 71st session, this is the first session we have hosted since March so it's exiting to get back into the swing of things.
Here is tonight's agenda for those who haven't seen it already: 
71st session agenda</div>
71st session Agenda 3rd Parliament, 71st session European &amp; African Session 16 April 2021 at 8PM UTC / 3PM EST    The following document is the official agenda and the associated resources of the 71st  Parliament session. The 71st session is a European &amp; African Session scheduled to be hosted...</div>
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is intermittently present.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Burdette is present
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
Plushunia is present (intermittently)
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I must also add that this evening's session will be the first to be covered in the Cupertino Gazette, which is being revitalised after more than a year of absense.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Kudos.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Lovely.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Which brings me onto my first item for discussion which is how we will be conducting the Gazette.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present
DrOwl: 
West River is present
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Is there anything further to comment on this topic?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe we are awaiting the chair.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I hope that the Chair does not have technical issues with his wifi again
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Indeed.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Chair is offline.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If so will Mr. Lieutenant chair take over?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
would you be able to temporarily step in?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Seems as if his wifi cut out again, yes I can step in.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Hopefully this issue resolves itself soon enough.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I do not have any information on the topic of conducting the Gazette, so I shall move onto the first discussion topic of the agenda on the renewal of the CA Factbook Project in June-July.
It seems as if he is back online.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I must apologise to everyone - someone unplugged my router for ~5 minutes.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
However so unfortunate.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Welcome back.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As I was saying, our options for the Gazette are to:
I believe that B. is the better option, considering the fact that A. is a lot more work considering that we now have a new timetable.
The floor is open to discussion.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would say option B is better as there is a bigger chance it stays active that way.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I must note, is this still being conducted under the purview of the Ministry of Public Affairs? If not, we might need to review the current legislation in place.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Is the gazette not able to organise themselves?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I must note, is this still being conducted under the purview of the Ministry of Public Affairs? If not, we might need to review the current legislation in place.
I will be running the first one and then I'll be handing over to Anthony of Saspearian.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe Option B would be a more viable option for the Gazette since for all three session most of the same issues will likely be covered.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Would this question not be better answered by the authors of the gazette, rather than who they will be covering?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think a publication every 3 sessions is ideal. It would be of an optimal length, and I’m looking out for the Minister of Public Affairs by not making him do a new publication following every session.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Would this question not be better answered by the authors of the gazette, rather than who they will be covering?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I seem to have misunderstood, this is a discussion, not a resolution, apologies.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
No worries.
Unless anybody has anything they wish to add, we shall be moving on.
if he so wishes.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Mr. Chair, may I?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Excuse me as I will be gone for a minute.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
As the co-leader and one of the main contributors to the February CA Factbook Project, I believe it would be a great idea to renew this project possibly over the summer. The factbook was viewed favorably within the community boosting the reputation of this organization and also was very well-made.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
May I have the floor?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
You may.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you Mr. Vice Chair.
I cede.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
What is the purpose of the factbook?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
To answer your question yes.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I do not have any comments for the Factbook today
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm back.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don’t know much about the factbook, so I cannot comment.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
The intention of the factbook was to showcase all member nations in one compilation including census data(if applicable), geography, political systems, etc.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Considering how well received the Factbook was last time, it would be nothing short of ridiculous to not continue it this year.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
For reference here is the February 2021 Factbook: <a href="https://issuu.com/curio_rblx/docs/cafactbookfeb2021">https://issuu.com/curio_rblx/docs/cafactbookfeb2021</a>
Cupertino Alliance Factbook | February 2021</div>
The premier guide on geographical, population, and governmental information about micronations in the Cupertino Alliance.</div>
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I am not particularly familiar with the program, but this seems fairly popular, and would have few drawbacks.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
The process of creating the factbook would also run more smoothly given the fact that we have prior experience and pre-existing framework for the creation of a new factbook.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This seems like a good idea.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
For most participants, most of the information is there already.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would support this. It was a really good reference for Atiera, and I would really love to see how much our nation (and others) have grown since February.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Does anybody wish to add anything further?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
None from me.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nothing from maple.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Alright moving on to the proposal from <span class="mention" title="Dhrub#6459">@Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra</span>.

This is with reference to the order issued by the Chair of GUM, Mr. Dean on Andrew Perdomo
I cede.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you Mr. Roy.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This seems rather, authoritarian no?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
This seems like it would give the chair or supreme judge way too much power.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I agree.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If there's an actual reason to ban the individual, e.g. Daniel Morris, then I believe that it's perfectly fine.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Perhaps there should be a vote of confirmation by the CA parliament?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The reasons are well mentioned; and more reasons could be added as members propose.
I agree with Xia
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I disagree with this bill entirely.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
We could amend the bill to such
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I think that would work.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
There is little recourse for the nation, should the chair act in a irresponsible manner.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
In regards to 3. Discrimination and indeed every example, I believe that we should make this muchh clearer.
<div class="quote">There is little recourse for the nation, should the chair act in a irresponsible manner.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't think we should ban people, because they made an environment that might offend someone.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If they cannot be trusted with making clear and responsible calls such as this, then they shouldn't be Chair.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
All due respect, that's not how checks and balances work.
Yes, but people can lie.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is intermittently present.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Then why don't we just give the Chair all the power?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I agree.
It doesn't matter how trust worthy or how nice the chair is.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That is a fair observation.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
What if the power is vested in the CA Parliament would you support such then?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
How so?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We amend my proposal from The Chair and Supreme Judge to the Parliament
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Instead of the Chair making the calls, it's up the Parliament.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The Parliament shall have the right to ban an individual outside the CA
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Delegates vote on whether to ban an individual essentially
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I believe that would be the better option than vesting the power into the chair.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Is it not fair if I re-introduce it tomorrow?
With all necessary inputs and changes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If you so wish to.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I understand what this bill attempts to address, but this is not how to do it.
It would be better if something like a committee was elected to vote on bans.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
What will you suggest for it then?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That would be over-bureaucracy
The Parliament is being given the right to do so, what's your objection to it then?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
It would be more agile than the Parliament, but be more trustworthy than a single person.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I agree, I would say it's just best with Parliament.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think Parliament having a say is best. No need for extra committees, we already exist. Let’s keep things slimmer.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't think there is a need to be agile, as well they aren't even in the organization yet.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As I said, I would reintroduce it tomorrow with better highlight on the bill and necessary changes
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Sounds good
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
If any member has any proposal to the bill, you may please inform me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
None from I.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall move on.
Next up we have discussion regarding the appointment of Dhrubajyoti Roy as Deputy Minister of Asian &amp; Oceanic Affairs.
Would anybody like to speak regarding this?
I must add that this is to confirm him in the role, rather than appoint him.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I think it would be fitting, really nothing else to say.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
May I ask if this proposal too will need to pass through three readings?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I have no comment, other than I think he would fill the role well.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe Mr. Roy will be fine in the position he is being confirmed into
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I do not know this person, and will consult with leadership on how to vote.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Using the precedent set by the confirmation of the original cabinet, I assume not.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">May I ask if this proposal too will need to pass through three readings?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Duly noted.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
You may choose to look on Microwiki about this person.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that Mr. Roy would be a great fit for the role and will hopefully bring around some much-needed growth and revitalisation towards the Asian region of the CA.
I look forward to seeing his tenure.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I look forward to serve to the best of my knowledge and ability, something that I was unable to fulfil in my past tenure. In addition, it is worth mentioning that I currently have charge of leading/helping four organizations with their ambitions on Asian development
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed, Mr. Roy's experience and connections to Asian nations and groups will be absolutely perfect for the role.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I think he would be fit for the position.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Can we move on?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you for the comments, honourable members.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I concur.
Kudos.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is no longer present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We shall move on unless anybody wishes to add anything further.
Next up we have the downgrading of Moletopia, Caddia and Regelis to Observers for inactivity.
The floor is open to discussion.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I haven’t heard from Moletopia in a while.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I was told it is because of school.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would vote in favor. I haven’t heard from any of them in a while, inside or outside of the Alliance.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I have heard from Regelis outside of the alliance, but not much from inside.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm not sure what's happened about Caddia either.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
Me neither.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have returned to the session.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Noted.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wish to make a point of note.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">I must quickly add that if you haven't voted on the inactivity votes for West River and Georgienstine yet I highly recommend you do in <span class="mention">#voting-hall</span>.
<div class="quote">I wish to make a point of note.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Regarding Caddia, I would be in favour of straight up expulsion. This isn't the first time this has happened with them in the alliance, and I can almost ascertain this demotion won't bring them back.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't think that Leah Telford is even a member of the community by this point.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe this is an accurate statement.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I know that she's a member of the TOES group chat but that's it.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
None from I
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall move on.

Great Des Plaines Valley War</div>
The Great Des Plaines Valley War or the Weg-Rodentian War is an ongoing conflict between members of the Alley Coalition and UDCTC against the Urraca Pact. The conflict began when Edward Oaches, Jack O’rav and a group of mercenaries overthrew the Rodentian Government and military. The mercenaries and the standing Rodentia military became part of ...</div>
I will quickly explain my reasoning for this.
<div class="quote">I think we should condemn the war.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I would motion to support Monmark, and other nations.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Considering the fact that 3 member states are actively engaging in the conflict, 3 member states and 2 former states have pledged their diplomatic support for one or more sides and numerous member states have been affected by it in one way or another, I believe that we should discuss taking a stance on it - do we condemn one side? offer diplomatic support to end the conflict? or do we condemn the conflict in general?
The floor is open to discussion.
James B. - Desert District: 
Leah *
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Could we just stay out of it?
Make no statement at all.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
We must support Monmark in the least.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Leah *
James B. - Desert District: 
Why?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
They <strong>are</strong> apart of the CA.
James B. - Desert District: 
Let’s just stay out of it.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wish for the floor.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The Alliance should either condemn the war or stay completely out of it.
LamentTwice: 
I believe we should make no effort to support it. War is childish.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I wish for the floor.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Cupertino Alliance needs to stay out of this conflict. This conflict is so far isolated in a specific region of the US, dragging in other micronations merely due to holdings in the area.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Could I have some clarification?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur with the honorable delegate from West Sayville.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If the CA makes a statement, I will consider pulling my nation out of the CA.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Monmark, is apart of the CA, correct?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Foreign policy is a domestic responsibility
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This is childish.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Micronational war is also childish. We should either condemn war in general or stay out of it. I believe involving ourselves will only harm the reputation of the Alliance.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Whilst so, it is not unreasonable for a nation to avoid being dragged into disputes it wishes to not associate with.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
That is unreasonable.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that everyone has made perfectly valid points regarding this.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
The war has gotten to the point where there’s difficulty regarding diplomatic actions.
James B. - Desert District: 
It would indirectly make Desert District has a stance if we get involved.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I must object and stand with Monmark.
James B. - Desert District: 
But we do not have a stance.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I do hope that the record will show that I am in stark opposition to doing nothing.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
And you may do so, independently of the Alliance.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
We would have difficulties with diplomatic intervention as an organization.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
I do not believe we should intervene in this conflict.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Does anybody wish to add anything further before we move on then?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
We need make only a statement in support of Nation's that had nothing to do with the start of the conflict, and got invaded, chiefly, or limited to CA nations, lIkE moNmArk.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
Every nation has its own individual policy, but that does not mean the CA as a whole should support any side in that conflict.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Ms. Dobrev.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
In other words there would be a lot of drawbacks to the Cupertino Alliance diplomatically intervening in the conflict.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is no longer present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe I have made my stance extensively clear, I have nothing more to add.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you, we shall move on.
James B. - Desert District: 
Which is very concerning.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
May I add something?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go on then.
James B. - Desert District: 
Your nation can take a stance,
do not force us to.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
I do not believe the CA should participate in the war, however, if our members are concerned about the conflict, the Alliance could try to mediate it.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I feel that further discussion here will be fruitless, and all comments on this subject should be moved to a more deserving channel.
There is more business, and this is going no where.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Again, anybody wish to add anything further?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
The problem is that there have been reported difficulties of diplomatic actions between both sides in the war. But we should definitely consider giving it a shot.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Next up we have the Internet Privacy Initiative, which I would hand over to Tyler Mullins however he is unfortunately not present this evening.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
That seems like a bad Idea.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
How so?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'll give everyone a few minutes to read the document then we shall discuss it.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
In reference to mediating, but this should be discussed somewhere else
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed it should.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This is less of an initiative and more of a memo, no?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The floor is now open to discussion.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I must concur with the Delegate of Maple.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think the purpose of the initiative is more to educate delegates regarding the safe utilisation of the internet.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I disagree with the use of Tor, but see no reason in striking it from the Initiative.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I agree. While I believe this is very important information and should be acted on by each delegate individually, not sure what the Alliance at large is supposed to do about it.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Chiefly in respect to privacy
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I agree. While I believe this is very important information and should be acted on by each delegate individually, not sure what the Alliance at large is supposed to do about it.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Indeed.
There is very little the CA can do in that area.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't think he needed to include how to access the dark web.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I agree but, no doubt, he will argue that it is for privacy.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
I believe that the concept is good, however some sections could be done a bit better.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I disagree with the Classification of the document as an initiative, as it directs the CA to do nothing, and is more of a memo, and I disagree with including 3.Tor browser is also how you reach the “dark web” and.onion sites., and would omit it, or doctor it in a manner to remove reference to the dark web.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Could we move onto the next piece of legislation?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed we shall.
We'll move onto the applications next.

This is correct. It's not an initiative per se, but is a memo with the intention of sparking interest and education.

I will most likely be abstaining on Revalia.

Personally I believe that it would be great to have an Estonian nation within the CA.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
By the sound of them, they seem pretty alright.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
They seem well developed for their age. Lots of ministries and even sports

Almost certainly a no from me.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Can you expand on why?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Parading the fact that you raided a server on your MW page is a hard no.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Oh my
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">The DRotUCE found that tarnova had many nazis, which Tarnova did not censor in any way. The DRotUCE did not like this, and tried to get the government to change this. It culminated in an operation in which a DRotUCEian spy was granted admin within Tarnova, and was supposed to use it to ban the nazis, and remove the related channels. The spy was unable to do this, and instead decided to remove all the channels and taunt the Tarnovans until the server owner came along and banned him.</div>
Warmedic - Monmark: 
That seems childish and irresponsible, also a no.

I don't think they are worthy of CA membership.

I admit I'm not a fan either
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I have no further comments.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then moving on.

They seem alright to me based on experience with their delegates.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'm still a little iffy just because of the name, but I'd be willing to give them a try.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I concur, I have had much the same experience.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would be willing to give these a shot.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
What is wrong with their name?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I would be willing to give these a shot.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
On the other hand, Waterside Park is worthy of CA membership.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I see no reason in giving them membership from a brief glance.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Waterside Park is a close ally of New Athens
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Indeed.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I strongly support their membership
Warmedic - Monmark: 
They are good people, and my personal experience with them has been without complaint.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Shall we move on then?
Co-operative Republic of Wendatia
Co-operative Republic of Wendatia</div>
The Co-operative Republic of Wendatia, formerly known as the Republic of Wendatia is a micronation located in Metro Detroit, spanning Wayne, Oakland, and Macomb counties.

Their page is good and my experiences with their leader have mostly been alright.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I've heard good things about them
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I have had favorable, though limited, experiences with Wendatia. Our two nations are very close in proximity as well.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I know nothing about them.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
They were previously a member of the organisation prior to their expulsion in late 2020.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will note they have increased in professionalism tenfold since their expulsion.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Wasn't it ~June 2020?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Why was their membership terminated?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I will note they have increased in professionalism tenfold since their expulsion.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I think they had several PM's who didn't know they were the PM.

It was around November/October, if I recall.

I do not believe that there is.

I concur.
That is unfortunate.
Can we move on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed we shall.
Unfortunately the next 5 applicants do not currently have remarks due to the unavailability of Mr. Montan. 
Republic of Tavil</div>

The fact that they claim Bir Tawil is a big no from me.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Another Bir Tawil nation

I agree.

Their page seems modestly developed.
I'd be willing to give them a chance as an observer.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
We vote on observers?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Everyone has a chance as an observer.
Personally I believe that they would be an alright member by the looks of things.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I mean they ban opposition parties but I suppose I would be willing to give them a shot.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Mmmmmm
I will refer to leadership for advice here.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
And it looks like only 4/12 of there national assembly seats are filled.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Regardless, I'd be willing to give them a chance.
Moving on then. 
Kingdom of Northwood-Oregon</div>
Northwood-Oregon (/nɔrˌθwʊd-ˈɔrə,gan/), officially the Kingdom of Northwood-Oregon, is a micronation located in Northwest Ohio, USA which was founded on 29 September 2020.

Definitely a yes from me.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I've spoken with the leader of Northwood-Oregon. We have a treaty. They are very kind and professional.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their page is very developed, my experiences with their delegates have been superb, I could go on.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'm definitely voting yes.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I don't know them, I will refer to Leadership.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
I'd be in favor of admitting the KNO as a member state.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I support them being admitted as a Member State.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
DrOwl: 
I am in favour of their admission.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I mean the name itself break MicroWiki Manual of Style.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Regardless, it's still a very well developed page.
Moving on then. 
Warmedic - Monmark: 
A manual of style?
Aside from grammar, that seems redundant.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The lack of MicroWiki page or website makes it a no for me.
DrOwl: 
Their server has only nine members.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Never heard of them.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
They seem underdeveloped from what I can see unfortunately
It's going to be a no from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
We could definitely help them get more developed if they were to join CASC.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur as well
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
With things like a MicroWiki, page or a website.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Does anybody have the Discord account of their delegate?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
They should still be allowed to become an observer.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
On the topic of the CASC, should we direct every rejected member towards the CASC in the future?
DrOwl: 
I think that is a great idea.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
The what now?
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Time can fix that.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia:

And should they join, the CA should provide them many resources, and help educate them in how to do things properly.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

We can't accept every single nation to help them grow.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wish to make a statement on CASC.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am disappointed on how CASC was implemented. Merited or not, it should have been discussed in a session beforehand.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Hear hear.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I do concur on some level, perhaps we should hold the CASC in a hiatus until we fully discuss it?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I am disappointed on how CASC was implemented. Merited or not, it should have been discussed in a session beforehand.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I don't see that as necessary.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If people wish to discuss CASC then we can do it at the end of this session.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I feel like that could be detrimental to the nations there.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It would be preferable if a vote was held on it. There are valid points for whether it should or should not exist.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Suspending the rules?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Suspending the rules?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This wasn't on the agenda, was it?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It was not, no.
That's why I'm suggesting the discussion at the end.
We shall move on anyways though.
Novus Hierosolymis
Novus Hierosolymis</div>

Their page isn't too bad, and my experience with their delegates has mostly been positive.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Quite new.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
They could be a nice addition to the Asian &amp; Oceanic sector
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Considering the fact that they are located in Asia, I believe that they could be helpful in growing the Asian sector.
<div class="quote">They could be a nice addition to the Asian &amp; Oceanic hemisphere

Nothing here
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall finally discuss the CASC.
Anybody wish to take the floor?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
If I may?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Could I note we skipped 
Warmedic - Monmark: 
That seems like a problem.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Both items will be left until the next session - Mr. Lycon should be discussing the former whilst the latter isn't currently complete.
<div class="quote">If I may?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
The CASC is an excellent place for nations that are underdeveloped, but can grow and then they may be fully initiated into the CA. Additionally, they help expand out sphere of influence, and is generally, useful in all repects.
I yield.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you and I concur.
The system has worked perfectly well for the GUM, why can't it work for us?
It's doing alright so far as well.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Indeed

Before we begin with the formal agenda, shall we mourn a minute for the late HRH Duke of Edinburgh?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur with the Honourable delegate. His funeral just concluded.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Indeed.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I do not see the need- it is a macronational event, not a micronational one.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
He was a human being, who has made contributions for the world at large.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
There are lots of important people that have passed recently that the CA has not mentioned. I don't think that the Duke of Edinburgh should be an exception to this.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They did not do; but we can start with the Duke.
It's no harm into this.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Gentlemen, there is no need to start an argument over this. Ultimately, the Honorable speaker will decide whether it happens or not.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I have returned.
Considering that just recently His Royal Highness, Prince Phillip, the Duke of Edinburgh, had his funeral service, I think that it would be respectful to have one minute of silence, before I commence.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with the Honourable Speaker and thank you for considering my proposal.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let us begin.
First on tonight's agenda is a discussion period regarding renewal of the Cupertino Alliance Factbook.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I support it I guess, over the summer would probably be the best time.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Checking the previous session, the contributors plan to update the Factbook to keep it up to date. Does anybody have any questions or comments?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from my end.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Here is the February 2021 Factbook for reference.

Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis:

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Chandrachur Basu faced charges in Vishwamitra and I believe he'd also be tried under this.
I believe, there are charges on him in Australis as well.

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would concur with downgrading them.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
As would I.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
In my opinion, Caddia should be downgraded as they were previously expelled from the organisation for activity, rejoined and promised activity, something which never came.
Possibly expelled.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
When did Moletopia leave CA?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Today.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't even remember the last time, Caddia speaked.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The Chair is yet to recognize that I suppose.
Maple left
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Regelis should be considered for a downgrade - they had a high level of professionalism and activity, but it seems they've gone inactive.
Oh wait
Stand by.
William Cooper - Galte: 
We never did idk what you guys are talking about
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Many apologies
I mistook you for Maple. My bad.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Both are Canadian micronations, maybe that confused you.
But it is fine.
William Cooper - Galte: 
Although I will agree that we have been less than active.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Please confirm your presence first before speaking on the floor.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's fine. His presence is noted.
William Cooper - Galte: 
My apologies
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Back to the topic at hand - does anybody have any comment on the proposed downgrading of these member states?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would not suggest for Moletopia as the Grand Duke has spoken during today's session.
Caddia is a nation which I have not heard since I joined CA first, in October'2020.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Note that the Honourable Delegate had not previously messaged since mid March.
William Cooper - Galte: 
While I would take exception to being downgraded, I do understand the reasoning behind it
And would not necessarily oppose it
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Should you show increased activity, you could avoid a downgrade.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe, we should discuss Moletopia is some other sessions, especially because of their delegate's presence today.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
If there is no further comment on this topic, I believe we should move on.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Indeed.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The Great Des Plaines Valley War is an ongoing conflict involving several of our member states, in a coalition diplomatically supporting Wegmat against Rodentia, if memory serves me correctly. There have been calls by some for the CA to make an official response to this matter.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville:

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I am strongly against doing anything.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As am I.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I see this as an unnecessary move to condemn or make any statement on the war, especially that micronational wars are nothing but fun events.
I see micronational wars as nothing but useless stuffs.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur. If the Alliance must take a stance, we should condemn ALL micronational war, but we ideally would just stay out of it in general.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with the Honourable Delegate from Atiera.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
If there is desire among members to try and mediate peace talks, as the CA, in the conflict, I believe we could do it. But, personally, I'd rather stay away from all conflicts.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
There is precedent, however - in early 2020, I believe the CA engaged in peacekeeping and negotiations over a land dispute.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with the Plushunian delegate; but also, I don't think the other party (Rodentia) will welcome any negotiation
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
However, the CA has changed a lot since then.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think, considering the state of the Alliance and where we intend to go from here, there is much more harm than good that comes with getting involved.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree.
Does anybody have any further comments on the matter?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from our end.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
There is no good reason to intervene.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't think we should try to mediate.
No more from I.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is intermittently present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
The conflict is localized and is just a bit of fun as of now- if the CA gets involved, I believe there is a chance that nations will take it seriously and join 'unironically', which would not be good.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah, I agree. It seems we have a consensus that action should not be taken at this time.

, is the Internet Privacy Initiative.
From what I can gather, this is a document meant to show delegates how to be safer online.
Does anybody have any questions or comments, or ideas how we can utilise this initiative?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I’d simply like to draw attention to my comment on the matter from yesterday, as I still think this is true. 
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Not really, I don’t think it has any purpose in this meeting. I think it’s helpful but in set just a guide.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe we can try to push the messages shared in this document, to help our online delegates.
But I'm not sure how. In the next session, if Mr. Mullins is present, I assume he can talk about it further as he wrote it.

Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Nope.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If I may, I'd like to just raise an idea I've been thinking of lately.
And that is that I think that the CA should implement member state based votes, as opposed to delegate votes. The reason I suggest this is because in the Cupertino Alliance, we are not representing ourselves, but member states. I believe this could also simplify issues relating to concerns that some delegations are disadvantaged due to their inability/unwillingness to have a secondary or tertiary delegate.
James B. - Desert District: 
I disagree.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Why?
James B. - Desert District: 
, and I did not appoint him to increase our influence.
In Desert District,
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Why is that relevant?
James B. - Desert District: 
we work together incredibly well but nevertheless we represent different parties.
I appointed him as a way that not just the First Secy. can be represented in voting, but even those with different views on our development can.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
So resolve in your legislature how to vote in the CA as one nation.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I agree with Mr. Hamilton.
James B. - Desert District: 
That would take immense difficulty.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Why so?
James B. - Desert District: 
Some members live near us, some live in Colorado, it’s hard to get us online at the same time.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Hamilton*
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe he goes by Mr. Hamilton now, for the record.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
My bad.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
All good.
Do any other delegates have a particular stance on my suggestion?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
But do we really want to say that one member state can have 3 times the influence of another one just because they have more delegates?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe Atiera could implement this well, I support it.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would agree with this.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'll see how this goes in the next session as well - and should have an act drafted for the session after that.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Would it have to be an amendment?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think so.
If there is no further comment, I suggest we move onto membership applications.

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Definitely a no from our end; They had a coup recently
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They have a day to celebrate the coup as a holiday.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Yikes.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That's odd to say the least.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
No convincing application comments, and the wiki article is just...
poor.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Just from a quick glance, the article appears to refer to the nation in the past tense? Odd.
That might just be one error, I wasn’t reading particularly closely.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
So they say the coup failed.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
To quote Simon Cowell: It's a no from me.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
They also say this is a compilation of images from the coup attempt. Very much a no vote from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Still I don’t think this should be celebrated.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Are they claiming this was a coup in their nation?
That killed 57 people?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
To the best of my understanding, yes.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, in their own nation.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Honestly I don't know why we're still giving this application time. It's an obvious no, and we should move on.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Agreed.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Atiera will no longer be present, thank you for a successful session thus far.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Have a good day, Mr. Shepard.
Moving on, we have the second reading of the Socialist Republic of Pacificonia.
Discord: We don't have one because not many citizens use discord
Pacificonia</div>
The Communal Republic of Pacificonia, or Pacificonia, is a self-declared nation that most outside observers would call a micronation located in the Northwest United States. Pacificonia is a democratic nation, though the current president has no term limits, with a government the is defined by its constitution. The highest power in the government...</div>
I've never heard of Pacificonia, but it honestly looks like it could be a good fit for the Alliance.
At least Observer status.
Their article is quite detailed
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah as Observer but maybe not Member.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Do we offer separate roles?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
What do you mean?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We can give them Observer status.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I mean do we offer separate observership and membership? As far as I know, any nation accepted into first serve as observer and then are promoted as full members
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Well there's a vote to promote them to full members. If the voters see that they should remain observers, they can vote accordingly.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I started as a member.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah same, Australis joined before the observer then full member system.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The system here and in GUM are different
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Correct, alas we're going a little bit off topic now.
Shall we move on?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright.
Kingdom of Northwood-Oregon
Kingdom of Northwood-Oregon</div>
Northwood-Oregon (/nɔrˌθwʊd-ˈɔrə,gan/), officially the Kingdom of Northwood-Oregon, is a micronation located in Northwest Ohio, USA which was founded on 29 September 2020. The Kingdom has ninety two citizens with fifty-eight of those citizens residing directly in land claimed by the Kingdom. Those not residing around land claimed by the Kingdom ...</div>
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Definitely an yes from my end
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Agreed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We've a MRT with them, truly a professional nation
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They seem good.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I've had communication with their leader - though I haven't gotten back in touch with them.
I'm going to vote in favour when it comes time to vote.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Recently, their leaders were conferred the Order of Diplomatic Service Merit
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
How has the session gone so far?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Very good, Mr. Chair. We had quite high activity before the applications, but we're still keeping it running smoothly with a few members present at the moment.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Excellent to hear that.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Session has been running for 1 hour and 20 minutes.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
On the topic of the Northwood-Oregon applicant, I must say that this is one of the best applicants we have had in a while.
My experience with them has been nothing but professional.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Shall we move on now that we have reached consensus on this applicant?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur as well
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed we should.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Coming off the high of the last applicant we have South Corsica.
Corse du Sud (Preferably South Corsica)
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Principality_of_South_Corsica">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Principality_of_South_Corsica</a>
Principality of South Corsica</div>
Template:Principality of South Corsica</div>
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Where is this nation from?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The wiki article is basically nonexistent, and it is very new. I believe that therefore, it has grounds for an executive rejection by the Chairman.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Europe, Corsica
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Oh, so it is a French nation?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes, presumably.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Duly noted. Thanks.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Do we even know when they formed?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The wiki article was created on 8 April
The application says it's relatively new.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hard no. In a couple months maybe a observation pass.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah. Again, grounds for an executive rejection.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Area claimed = 82.03 km2
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Oh God, I didn't even see that.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The Hon. delegate from Qaflana has twice mentioned of observership, I don't think that CA offers observership like the GUM does.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that we should take a look into a member position like the GUM's observership in the future though.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Exactly what I mean, let them see session hall and such and if they improve, they can become members.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Would it not be worth directing them towards support groups and letting them reapply in a few months?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah, we can encourage them to join the new application server, or whatever it is.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The CASC.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Is there any more discussion on this nation before we move onto our final application?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Oh alright
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Finally, we have Novus Hierosolymis
<a href="https://discord.gg/nt9rsUrPRN">https://discord.gg/nt9rsUrPRN</a>
Novus Hierosolymis</div>
Novus Hierosolymis (/noʊvʌs hiɛɻosɔˈlʊˀmˈɪz/), formally known as the Most Holy Kingdom of Novus Hierosolymis, is a micronation established as the continuation of the medieval Kingdom of Jerusalem and the Holy Roman Empire. It is a semi-constitutional monarchy, ruled over by King Rilus I.</div>
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Poetic, that’s for sure.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I've seen worse pages before quite frankly.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Well, to be very honest, the leader had a small argument with me when I said him about professionalism, but when he understand he apologised
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd be willing to give them a chance during the observer period.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They seem to be a professional nation.
Well, will their land claims be a problem?
Also that the leader runs two nations (with same claims), I believe.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
He put his whole family on the MW page.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
And that of his Girlfriend, who's the consort
Not going too far, he is just 13 and mentions of his consort
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think that it would be worth letting them in.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Also, I suppose it'd be a benefit for the Asia sector
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
and the first Philippine nation to come out of their isolationist groups
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We need as many new nations in the Asian sector as we can get.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We should encourage it's development and growth.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd be speaking to Queensland, in this respect.
But they'd be pleased to join now
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A chance as an observer would be a good opportunity to help them grow.
<div class="quote">But they'd be pleased to join now
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
2 weeks is not a perfect time to grow; but yes, we should amend our membership criterions I believe
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
There doesn’t appear to be much information about them.
Wait
I thought we were still discussing South Corsica.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We left them far back
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If there is no more discussion on this nation, I feel like we should adjourn in five minutes, unless anybody has any proposals.
Session is adjourned at 1 hour and 45 minutes long.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright we should have enough for a session.
Welcome and thank you to everyone for taking the time to attend this evening's session, because Thorin Neal is not currently present I shall be hosting the session for the next 15ish minutes until either he or someone else takes over.

Anybody have anything they wish to bring up before we begin?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall start.
Before we get onto the items on the agenda I would like to cover a few things.
As you may have noticed, this weekend marked the introduction of the new session timetable following recommendations from the Session survey.
It is a very rigorous timetable, so I must ask everyone what they think of it.
Also I believe that Thorin has arrived.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes I have.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I shall hand over to you following my next proposal if that is alright?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
It is very accommodating to my personal schedule, and I am therefore grateful.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I personally enjoy it also.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I share the same opinion as the Monmark delegate.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I rather like the timetable because it gives me 5 days to plan the agendas whilst having a set time for sessions which are close together.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Anymore comments before we begin with our discussions?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
None from Monmark.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
The new schedule has been working out well.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, lets begin with the discussion on the Factbook Renewal.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It is a bit weird but I suppose I can attend them all.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The Factbook was helpful to many users, and was well recieved.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed - I see absolutely no reason why we shouldn't do it again.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unlike last time, the framework has already been laid out for most nations so it should be easier to produce again.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<a href="https://issuu.com/curio_rblx/docs/cafactbookfeb2021">https://issuu.com/curio_rblx/docs/cafactbookfeb2021</a>
Cupertino Alliance Factbook | February 2021</div>
The premier guide on geographical, population, and governmental information about micronations in the Cupertino Alliance.</div>
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I support the renewal of the factbook, but I think the citizen count of each nation should not come from the CA census, as we, for example, have good citizen participation but few wanted to participate in the CA census so our factbook entry said we only had 4 citizens when that is wildly incorrect.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Here is the latest factbook.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I support the renewal of the factbook, but I think the citizen count of each nation should not come from the CA census, as we, for example, have good citizen participation but few wanted to participate in the CA census so our Facebook said we only had 4 citizens when that is wildly incorrect.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Resources in the community can be hard to come by besides the MicroWiki, which is somewhat controversial in some circles. This would be a nice diversification.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
There was other good things that came with the census.
Like it mentioned what percentage of religion the citizens follow.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Ignoring that slight hiccup we had with religion, I think it was very helpful with statistics.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I know how many citizens Burdette has just not all there religions and other data.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Due to school tomorrow morning, I will not be able to contribute sufficiently to this session so Aenopia will no longer be present. I will still be online and may pop in again during the applicants and to propose something.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur that it is useful for that purpose, but I keep a thorough roster of all of our citizens that contains that information. I can provide a redacted form to the factbook creator that would provide a factually correct form of this data
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Any more comments on the renewal of the Factbook?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
None from me
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I think it is a good idea, and should seriously be looked into and implemented.
Besides that, I have nothing further to add.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Are you there for your Proposal?
I'll come back to you.
Now we are discussing the Future of the Noted! Project.
I haven't currently heard much on the project.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Where is the letter now?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Jayden has not currently discussed that.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
We skip this until Mr. Lycon is here I believe.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I agree.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">I'll ping him and leave it at that. <span class="mention" title="EndQuote#2696">@Jayden Lycon - Qaflana</span>
Our next discussion is the Ministry's Activity Report results.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
We also skip this until Mr. Lycon is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yep.
Sorry for all the hiccups from members not being present.
Now we discuss the Downgrading of Moletopia, Caddia and Regelis to Observers.
I currently fully support this plan.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
It is fine, if anyone should apologize it should be them.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Moletopia spoke last session.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They understand why they may be downgraded, and of course they could always get back to Membership.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Yes but before that it had been a long long time.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
As Humberlean doesn't exactly have relations with these micronations I'm not sure on a majority of the info regarding this topic.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, I concur.
I haven't even heard anything on Caddia or Regelis.
I don't know if Caddia is even in this server.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Any comments?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
So nobody here knows exactly who they are?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Atleast I don't know Caddia.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Caddia has a representative.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I have hear of Regelis, but I have not actually interacted with them to the best of my kniwledge
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="leаh#3472">@leаh</span>
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Last spoke 4 months ago.
They even said forgot i was in this.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
In that case I would be ok with downgrading their membership.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don't think they should even be observer if there isn't even any sort of thought of this server.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
If anyone does have knowledge of inside their discord servers it would prove useful.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They went to 1 session, and just said Caddia is present and that's it.
Any further comments before we move on?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I have nothing more to say.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Next we have to discuss about the Des Plaines Valley Conflict.
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Great_Des_Plaines_Valley_War">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Great_Des_Plaines_Valley_War</a>
Great Des Plaines Valley War</div>
The Great Des Plaines Valley War or the Weg-Rodentian War is an ongoing conflict between members of the Alley Coalition and UDCTC against the Urraca Pact. The conflict began when Edward Oaches, Jack O’rav and a group of mercenaries overthrew the Rodentian Government and military. The mercenaries and the standing Rodentia military became part of ...</div>
Many of our members are participating.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I think we have talked enough about this to show there is a consensus that we should not make a statement.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I understand that, but we must discuss it for members who didn't go to the last session.
I think that we should purely go no comment on it.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I do not believe this organization should be involved in this conflict
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur, one of our own requirements is to not be in a war.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I had recently checked the microwiki article when looking on Ponderosa Hills, although I do concur we shouldn't get involved.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Now a representative of Monmark, I ask member nations to, if not in agency with the CA, at least in an independent fashion, support Monmark.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It seems very strange if we support it as a organization, especially since it is not the focus of the CA to do such actions.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with Mr. Neal.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I still see very little wrong in denouncing such obvious delinquency, and declaring bad acts, as just that, bad.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Decorum.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Sorry, just my statement.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
Plushunia is intermittently present
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe if it is in the interest of the individual member states they can take their own position on the matter, though I do not believe the organization as a whole should be involved.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
I concur with Mr. Xia.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Seeing as many of our members are in the actual war themselves, I think it is in our best action to just have no comment.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with Mr. Xia as well.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I feel that this apathy towards acknowledging that member states have been wronged, and refusing to say anything about it, is nothing more than allowing those wrongs to go unnoticed by the organisation, and the refusal to call out such actors is detrimental to the character of this organisation.
With that, I cede.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I apologise for my unexplained absence.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's alright.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well MW war in itself is more wrong in my opinion than just staying away from the issue entirely.
Woland - Desert District: 
Right.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
As Mr. Xia said, it should be the job of the individual micronation's to acknowledge the situation in their own ways, not the organization's.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We as a organization don't want to participate in war, that's not our focus. We can support you as much as outside the war as we can. That's my opinion.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I am not going to comment until I receive instructions from leadership to clarify what stance I should be taking here.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I repeat my sentiments from last session.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur with Mr. Valentinus.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
It is not our place to get involved.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I also concur with Mr. Valentinus.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I disagree that a statement is needlessly involving members, as I see it as the bear minimum, and additionally that would not mandate action from members to act on behalf of one side or the other.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Such a charged statement indirectly involves every single member of the alliance into this conflict.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think no statement is actually way better at seperating us, the Cupertino Alliance away from the war.
You can participate in the war all you want, we as a organization wants to stay clear of it however.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
A statement is the least possible amount of action.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I remind members that Monmark does not want war, and strongly protests being apart of such moronic conflicts. We were invaded.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that discussion regarding the Des Plaines conflict should have been removed following the 71st session.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I feel as no statement is even more less.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Hear hear.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
It is no action.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Sorry, it was on the agenda.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Which is great at separating us from the war even more.
Any further comments?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I think I have made my thoughts clear.
Can we move on.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Moving on.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I make a statement regarding Caddia?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Granted.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I will be absent for a short while, apologies.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Noted, it's alright.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Regarding Caddia, I feel that they should be immediately expelled as opposed to merely demotion to observer.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I stated that aswell.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This isn't the first time this has happened I must remind everyone.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They have no business here.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They even forgot they were in this server 5 months ago.
And they only showed up to one session, and never even added anything to it.
This is grounds for executive expel right?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I would imagine so.
I have returned.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe so yes.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's clear they never wanted to participate in the Cupertino Alliance at all, and I think that even reaching out to them would not be enough (If we already did that).
I think I, and many others think that they should not be in the Cupertino Alliance.
Let's get back on agenda however.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Hear hear.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Next, we have the discussion on the Internet Privacy Initiative.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Point of order?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don't see fully why we need to actually discuss it, however I believe Logan added it.
It is more just a guide, and not a actual proposal.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What exactly are we supposed to be discussing? It is not a piece of legislation, but rather a piece of advice from the Ministry of Homeland Security. 
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur, moving on. Does anyone have anything more to propose before we move on to the membership section of the session?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
None from monmark.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Ok, first we discuss about the republic of Tavil.
Republic of Tavil
Republic of Tavil</div>
The Republic of Tavil, also known as the Tavil or Tavilland, was a micronation located in the territory of the disputed Bir Tawil. It borders with Egypt in the north and Sudan in the south, east and west. Also in Turkey's Antalya province (Belkıs), Puerto Rico's (Berdwind States) has a very small region. It was established on 14 May 2020 and has...</div>
I personally think they do not fit into the CA.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I agree.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Any thoughts?
Seeing past sessions, not much members actually support Tavil.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
As members from the last session pointed out, they are extremely simulationist.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I will being voting no.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That should not factor in. At all.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think that should be not much of a problem in my opinion, however I don't think they seem fit much based on the information they gave us.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Decorum please.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
IMO?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That is informal.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It is a shortening of a phrase.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It is still informal language.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Did not know that.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
But that's besides the point, personally I do not think this micronation will be a good fit.
There's already a number of places which claim the same area
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with Mr. Xia.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Moving on.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If I recall correctly, shouldn't this be dismissed?
I recall the Bir Tawil amendment to the charter.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't think it passed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Logan wrote it in the agenda.
I haven't written the agenda.

They seem well as a nation.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens has formal relations with them. Their leader is very kind and professional. I'd support their entry.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I support their entry as well.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They seem very professional to me.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
They seem like a good addition to the Alliance.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Indeed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They also have many relations to us as separate entities, so they would fit in.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I can vouch for them, as I know their leader through the Commonwealth of Sayvillian Regions.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Any further comments?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
None.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd mostly be in support of them as members.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, I haven't heard anything that states otherwise.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Indeed.
I have not heard too much of them.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
They seem relatively new.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'm still iffy, good chance I vote no.
brooke &#128158;: 
I will vote for Jeff Pontus.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think because they are new we should give them a chance.

I'm truly sorry with this session, it is hard to host a day after another session.

It is fine.

No worries.

Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Australis present. I’ll be in and out.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unfortunately Mr. Roy is not present this evening to discuss this document.
This act propose to give Parliament the power to suspend delegates and individuals if need be.
The floor is open to discussion.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I much appreciate the changes that Mr. Roy made to the bill. It’s far better than it was in its first reading. I’ll be voting in favor.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I am in support of this and I believe that the improvement that Mr. Roy has made regarding the document since the 71st session with discussion is good to see.
<div class="quote">I much appreciate the changes that Mr. Roy made to the bill. It’s far better than it was in its first reading. I’ll be voting in favor.
CwabMan: 
I too concur.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
“Using someone’s preferred name, pronouns, and form of address” sounds like we should punish individuals for doing this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">“Using someone’s preferred name, pronouns, and form of address” sounds like we should punish individuals for doing this.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
So we want to ban them because they respect preferred pronouns?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This was my point worded badly. I’m sorry.
CwabMan: 
I think the right wording would be adding a Not to the start.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Indeed.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur, I imagine this is just a miswording on Mr. Roy’s part.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I presume so.
CwabMan: 
Indubitably.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that it would instead be better if Mr. Roy put refuses instead of not for that matter, else there may be a bit of misunderstanding.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Noted.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
CwabMan: 
I do.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead then.
CwabMan: 
In number 3, is various basis correct grammar, I look it up and Collinsdictionary.com states Bases is the plural of basis., is it supposed to be plural or not.
Because that seems peculiar when reading it out loud.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I presume that it isn't supposed to be a plural.
CwabMan: 
Ok thank you.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't believe that English is Mr. Roy's primary language but I'm not sure, in that case it's perfectly understandable.
Alright then moving on to the National Voting Act. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1erBjm9_LE7oegej_abI-XR3UrcqkhoqgeGQ4nmzx3aw/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1erBjm9_LE7oegej_abI-XR3UrcqkhoqgeGQ4nmzx3aw/edit</a>

This proposes that instead of having every delegate vote, we instead move over to voting on a national basis.
The floor is open to discussion.
CwabMan: 
What is a tertiary delegate
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that we were discussing this prior to the elections as well.
<div class="quote">What is a tertiary delegate

Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I support the act.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
My opinion is a bit split on this one.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I wholeheartedly support this motion.
CwabMan: 
Ah, I have no opinion on this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Overall it seems a bit unfair to allow every delegate to vote because there are some members like Aenopia or Saspearian for example which have only one delegate, whilst nations like Australis have the maximum number of delegates.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
If one delegate were to represent the vote of one nation, all nations would have the same representation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
CwabMan: 
Ah, Then I support this.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Although I support the act I think a better way to enable voting to just one delegate would be roles. The voting delegate gets a sort of “Higher Delegate” role and the ones who cannot vote a “Lower Delegate” role.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm not too sure on that actually.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I have heard from James Bornstein of Desert District mention something about there being more of a voice with 2 delegates having the ability to vote, please correct me if I am wrong.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
What if the delegate with the role is unavailable at the time of voting?
CwabMan: 
If the higher delegate is not able to attend would he be able to vote would the lower delegate get this responsibility?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I have also heard about the possibility of “vote stacking” with multiple delegates having the ability to vote.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
It would incline the nation to be more active in the alliance and possibly appoint another “Higher Delegate” while the other one is away.
CwabMan: 
indeed
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I have heard from James Bornstein of Desert District mention something about there being more of a voice with 2 delegates having the ability to vote, please correct me if I am wrong.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Anthony I - Saspearian:

Go ahead.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I mean about the previous statement.
Bias is bound to happen at some point.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
If Mr. Lycon is not here we may have a slight issue discussing it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A few days ago I stumbled upon this link which essentially covers a group which receives postcards from around the world and launches them into space. You may find the link here for further readnog: <a href="https://www.clubforfuture.org/missions/">https://www.clubforfuture.org/missions/</a>
Blue Origin Club for the Future | Postcards to Space</div>
Blue Origin Club of the Future.</div>
<div class="quote">If Mr. Lycon is not here we may have a slight issue discussing it.
My idea is that instead of last time, when we sent a letter to different nations, we instead send a postcard which can be signed by delegates before being mailed to Blue Origin to be launched into space as part of a Grand Finale.
The floor is open to discussion.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is now present and supports this idea
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
So would we virtually sign?
CwabMan: 
Would it be a Postcard to the whole alliance or to a specific country?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Physically like the first iteration of the Noted project.
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Noted_Project">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Noted_Project</a>
Noted Project</div>
The Noted! Project, also known as the Noted Project, Noted Tour or Noted Programme is a diplomatic tour within the Cupertino Alliance organised by Chairman Jayden Lycon.</div>
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
So we would mail it to all nations who want to participate and then ship it to space?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes, except we'd ship it to the company that launches it to space.
CwabMan: 
I think this sounds like a great idea
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am intrigued by the idea, and would enjoy participating.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It definitely would be an incredible end to the round I believe - the concept of an ambassador to the CA, even a postcard with a bunch of names on it, launching into space sounds superb to me.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Does any nation produce their own postcards?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Not that I'm aware of, however I did post a mock-up of what the one we would send to space would look like.
I'll try and find the screenshot.
And on the back would be empty space for delegates to write their names.
CwabMan: 
Thats my king!
I think this looks like a great post card.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It would have to be shipped in an envelope in order to protect the personal information of participants.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Interesting idea and a decent design.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unlike general postcards we cannot write the addresses of everyone on the back of course.
<div class="quote">Interesting idea and a decent design.
Unless anybody wishes to add anything further we shall move on.

Anthony I - Saspearian: 
It could possibly work out.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Apologies for my tardiness, I am feeling a tad under the weather today.
Monmark is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Last year we planned to host an environmental clean-up, however this was cancelled due to the restrictions regarding COVID.
Considering now that we can undertake this due to the relaxing of restrictions, I believe that it would be a great opportunity to not only clean up the territories of member states, but also preserve our environments.
CwabMan: 
The kingdom of humberlea hopes you feel better soon.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
We receive that statement with many thanks.
CwabMan: 
I agree.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We also planned to partner with the GUM on this, however they rejected this last year. Considering the fact that GUM-CA relations are much better now, it might be a good idea to invite them to join?
CwabMan: 
I have no opinion on this.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would love to see the GUM participate, but wouldn’t be surprised if they declined, strictly based on the Vice Chair’s behavior here, and the Chair’s reaction to jt, as of late.
brooke &#128158;: 
Oh hey, I can actually contribute something that isn’t a joke or decorum breach.
CwabMan: 
Who is the vice chair?
brooke &#128158;: 
What about the GUM?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Considering the fact that it's up to Quorum to decide, I don't believe that's entirely true.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I think this should be rescheduled for some later date as many nations are still seeing a resurgence of Covid.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's true.
brooke &#128158;: 
Not really, the executive has pretty clear authority to communicate with other organizations.

brooke &#128158;: 
I think it’s a pretty promising concept.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I think it is very important to educate people about the environment, and to do something about it, but I also feel that this might expose people to Covid, although I'm not certain.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I agree, it shouldn't require a lot of planning to conduct and it benefits everyone in the long term: Nations, local communities, the environment, etc.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with the delegate from Ponderosa Hills.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It's not that hard to wear a mask and stay 6 feet apart when picking up trash.

CwabMan: 
Indeed indeed,
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As an organisation we take no responsibility for any COVID infections because it's up to the participants to organise and safely conduct events like these.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Well if that's the case, then I see no issue with it.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
We should still encourage safety precautions and possibly offer some advice on how to proceed safely?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We should and we almost definitely will - it seems a bit stupid not to really.
Anybody wish to add anything else?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nothing from Monmark.

Swiftly moving onto the next item on the agenda which is a Sister Cities initiative.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is intermittently present.
brooke &#128158;:

Arguably, the CA would also be plagiarising itself.

CwabMan: 
What is Emery Cities sister city?
CwabMan: 
Yea the Planet has done it too.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Yes, I agree, I am not familiar with this project.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
There has been numerous projects like this way before the GUM decided to run with it.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As I was about to say, it would be a good way to improve and build relations between participating nations whilst also serving as a little bit of fun.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Cupertino Alliance already has this.
Granted, someone throwing the document into the bin doesn't exactly help our cause.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed, so it might be worth reconsidering this to suit our modern needs.
Perhaps it could work hand in hand with the CAoNI project?
CwabMan: 
I know must go, I am sorry for a early departure, Whether or not my king Nicholas Lokin will be present I do not know but once again I am sorry but I must be on my way now.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Sister City Project is something launched under the Bainbridge chairmanship in the GUM. The CA launched something similar under the... San Diego program?
Xia originally proposed it here, if I recall.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Is the pre-existing project still technically in force? I don't remember it being in the Great Repeal Bill.

Essentially it's a project that would cover the pairing of international cities in order to improve relations through commercial and cultural ties.
<div class="quote">Is the pre-existing project still technically in force? I don't remember it being in the Great Repeal Bill.

There is a major problem with this for starters. This relies on co-operation with the GUM.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed, it might be worth downscaling the project in order to suit us solely if we cannot organise GUM cooperation.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nothing from Monmark.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Nor from Waterside Park.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I ask how the Safeguarding Office operates at present?
I think such insight would  be beneficial, for the debate on this project.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As far as I'm aware they simply take any complaints that they receive and alert the Chair for further investigation.
I think it might be worth conducting a complete rethink of the Safeguarding Officer's role in the future.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I see.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall move on.
I think it might be worth leaving the final 2 discussion items for another session so we'll move onto applications.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They seem to lack a MicroWiki page but their website doesn't look awful.
It'll probably be an abstain from me.

The website looks really good.

<div class="quote">Our nation may be small, but its the nicest of them all</div>
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Chair, do we have a remarks report?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I’ll probably abstain as well.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Abstain or Aye from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Mr Chair, do we have a remarks report?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I’ll most likely abstain on voting for this nation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Considering the fact that this is the 2nd week of no remarks it is getting a bit concerning.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I ask that these membership readings cease and be postponed until the remarks reports are received.
I believe it is unfair to not only the applicants, but also to the delegates who are supposed to be voting on these prospective candidates.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Fair enough then.
Unless anybody wishes to add anything further, that'll be all for this session.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
None from me
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you to everyone who has attended today's session and a general reminder that the next session is set to take place at 17:00 EST tomorrow.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
OK, thank you.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
I will likely abstain as well.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I remind the Minister of Public Affairs that the session has concluded?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Oh wait
The session already ended.

Tyler Mullins - New Athens:

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Shouldn't he have a deputy then?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
He hasn't appointed a deputy.
Alright let's begin with the National Voting act. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1erBjm9_LE7oegej_abI-XR3UrcqkhoqgeGQ4nmzx3aw/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1erBjm9_LE7oegej_abI-XR3UrcqkhoqgeGQ4nmzx3aw/edit</a>

The floor is open to discussion.
CwabMan: 
Humberlea is present.
Sorry for being a bit late.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I am in support of this act however it would be a massive change for the way that the Alliance operates.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
I concur with logan.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I do think that the overall changes would be a net positive for the Alliance.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that somebody proposed that the primary delegate has access to the voting channel whilst other delegates do not which I am partial to.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I must disagree with that.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That system only works if the primary delegate is always available to vote
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If the main delegate is not present the the other delegates should be able to vote.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
INdeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It would significantly reduce the productivity of delegates and would overall defeat the point of having more than one delegate.
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Alright we'll move onto the next motion.
<div class="quote">A few days ago I stumbled upon this link which essentially covers a group which receives postcards from around the world and launches them into space.

Next up we have the Noted Project Phase 2.
CwabMan: 
true true, but having more delegates would have more opinions
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The floor is open to discussion.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I am greatly in favor of the noted phase 2 motion
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Those present last night will know my feelings about the concept as I am strongly in support of launching a postcard to space at the end of the project.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
As am I.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Is this free?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would enjoy participating on behalf of Atiera.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Is this free?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I'm in support of the second phase of the Noted Project.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd recommend that you all follow the link that I have attached for further information.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Will we actually be doing this?
CwabMan: 
indeed indeed i think this would be a intresting project.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Scroll down to the Q&amp;A section.
CwabMan: 
does it need space though?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Technically it states that it can either be about the chosen subject or anything the creator wishes.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Quite frankly that's the only loophole I need.
CwabMan: 
Personally i think we should focus on bettering the earth first.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I will be abstaining from this proposal.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Well you can't vote but sure.
CwabMan: 
indeed indeed.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Apologies
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't understand how you even have access to this channel anyway.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
im an observer
CwabMan: 
indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">When creating my postcard, do I specifically have to answer the question, “Why does Earth need space?”
Unless anybody wishes to add anything further shall we move on?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Observers are allowed to join sessions and discuss the items on the agenda but can't vote on the propositions or membership applications.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
apologies.
CwabMan: 
indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright we shall move onto the Cupertino Sister Cities proposal.
I shall find what I said regarding the subject last night to speed things up.
CwabMan: 
ok
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I believe that it would be a good way to improve and build relations between participating nations whilst also serving as a little bit of fun.
CwabMan: 
hmm I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The GUM has their own Sister Cities project which has proved successful so far and we formerly had our own however it fell into inactivity.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present for a bit
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The floor is open to discussion.
I must alert everyone that I might have to depart this session soon so I might have to appoint someone to act as a temporary speaker.
<div class="quote">The floor is open to discussion.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe that Atiera would participate if the Alliance goes through with this. I would enjoy doing so.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As far as I'm aware the original sister cities act was proposed back in July 2020 however it was quickly buried by other acts before we really got it started.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Burdette would consider participating.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Alright then moving on.
Next up we have the proposal for a Eurovision-like event.
In the past and indeed present there have been numerous Eurovision contests within the micronational community where participants send in songs of their choosing to be voted on by the collective.
CwabMan: 
Would it be the person preforming on video or just the songs?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Considering the fact that one of my goals as Chair is to introduce more fun events I believe that this would be an interesting and fun concept between member states.
<div class="quote">May I have the floor please?
<div class="quote">Would it be the person preforming on video or just the songs?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Aenderian government previously held a similar event- though we performed it ourselves / at least had some involvement in it. I am opposed to previous eurovision events in the community where participants just have to submit a youtube link to a random music video since that would take all the fun out of it

I yield.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur. I think having the respective micronationalists perform would be much more fun.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Perhaps continuing with the CrossChange brand?
CwabMan: 
Cupertinovision
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Perhaps - would it be worth asking individuals who worked on the original CrossChange project to provide assistance?
CwabMan: 
Good idea.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Me and Efton really
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If we are talking about Aenderians... I'm not too sure.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Maybe some of Efton's friends too If I recall
and possibly Chau Khang

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
However I understand what you mean.
<div class="quote">I mean the Fifth Republicans
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
When does the government plan to host the event?
Will it be limited to one submission per nation?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Some time at the end of May if we start soon.
CwabMan: 
GUMVision
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I hope to host the CA clean-up beforehand because that requires less planning.
<div class="quote">Will it be limited to one submission per nation?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Does the government plan for any award? I feel like that would be good
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have one worry about this. I dont wish this to be a repeat of the events surrounding the 69 Hour Session.
CwabMan: 
or we could call it... Microvision 2
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Does the government plan for any award? I feel like that would be good
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Problem with 69HS is that it was too lassezfaire
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I have one worry about this. I dont wish this to be a repeat of the events surrounding the 69 Hour Session.
Delegates found breaching the rules will be dealth with.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
After this topic may I have the floor please?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
The other problem was that it was a 69hr session.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Out of curiousity, would delegates be required to write their own songs or would covers be permitted?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">After this topic may I have the floor please?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I would approve of other covers but they performing them in some sort
I am not sure about the government
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Out of curiousity, would delegates be required to write their own songs or would covers be permitted?
CwabMan: 
Could the covers have to be approved by the people running the event? I don't think some songs would go very well.

<div class="quote">Could the covers have to be approved by the people running the event? I don't think some songs would go very well.
CwabMan: 
Very Epic.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Decorum.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Considering the topic is now over I shall proceed to have the floor.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
to its own ministry considering the uptick of events? If that happens I would be open to be Minister.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is no longer present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I disagree.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That would be a viable idea considering the fact that by the end of this weekend we may be planning:
Even if it's a temporary ministry.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We already have existing ministries we can delegate these tasks with. We have no need to make any more.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
What Ministries do you propose?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Minister of Public Affairs for one.
Maybe Ministry of Technology for digital summits?
CwabMan: 
Hmm, Elaborate on what they would do?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
That seems fair.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Fair
CwabMan: 
Tech for digital summits as in.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We already have the Minister of Environment and Geographical Affairs to handle the environmental clean-up.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Remandate it as Public Affairs and Events with Min. Environment and Tech helping?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That could work.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I disagree. Making a new mandate simply to change the name for something already under the ministries purview is a waste of time.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
To my question or something else?
I presume that's an indication to move on then.
Would it be worth discussing either the digital summit or the CA clean-up considering our previous discussion?
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" style="color: rgb(94, 197, 171); background-color: rgba(94, 197, 171, 0.1);">@Members</span>
CwabMan: 
Hmm.
I do not know.
I think not.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Personally, as Minister of Technology, I would be interested in helping to organize a digital summit if the Alliance allows me to. I think a summit would be beneficial.
CwabMan: 
What is a summit?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote"> a conference of highest-level officials (such as heads of government) an economic summit. summit.</div>
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
It's basically a gathering of nations where we all get together and discuss micronationalism, micronational affairs, and things of that matter.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Considering the fact that we aren't seeing sufficient discussion regarding this I feel like we'd be better off moving on.
CwabMan: 
Ok then.
CwabMan: 
I indeed believe this would be better for us and get us more members.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Next up we have the ERIE system.
<div class="quote">Establishing a system
I apologise for not attaching the Google Doc form as I completely forgot to look for t.
The floor is open to discussion.
Due to failing discussions with the GUM, I believe that it would be better if we initially used it for the CA-only.
CwabMan: 
What is a safeguarding issue?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Once we resume relations we can take another look then - it is clearly the intentions of both myself and Mr. Dean to cooperate with eachother.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As mentioned last session, until we break the GUM deadlock (given the fact discussions and the commission collapsed), this is going to be impossible.
We need rigid procedures in place.
I think we all know why, and there has been a good few notable instances in 2020 alone.
CwabMan: 
What would this protect us against?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Safeguarding issues.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Agreed.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I think we all know why, and there has been a good few notable instances in 2020 alone.
CwabMan: 
But what are we being Safeguarded from?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Paedophiles. Doxxers. Criminals. You name it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Pretty much.
We had some issues last year regarding some safeguarding issues so we should have this kind of system in place as it is.
CwabMan: 
Yikes, Alright I dont see why this would be a bad thing.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.

Alright next up we have applications.

Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
They look promising, but they seem too new in my opinion. I will likely abstain as well.
CwabMan: 
Hm, I think we need to know there land claims atleast.
And yes very new.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unfortunately they don't have a MicroWiki page so almost certainly an abstain from me.

I will as well.

The fact that they have a Soyuz spacecraft on their flag is a bit strange.
<div class="quote">These were a previous applicant, no?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
From what I've been provided, they seem like a suitable candidate for observership. Unless there's something major that I'm missing about them, I'll likely vote in favor.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I think that is wholly irrelevant to this discussion.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Agreed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Otherwise I think I'll support.
Actually I think I'll change mine to an abstain.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
To me, this looks like it was nearly 6 months ago.
Assuming it is 2020, of course.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further before we wrap up for tonight?

It probably was in 2020.
Nothing from me.

Does anybody have any comments, queries or concerns regarding this act?
CwabMan: 
Once again, Humberlea supports this Act completely.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
None from Wendatia.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I’m still divided on this act. I think it would be an overall net positive for the Alliance, but it seems very complicated to implement.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from Vishwamitra
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
There has been talks in Cabinet on how to improve the process.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
It seems like there’s a big flaw in every plan that’s been suggested thus far.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's rather difficult to implement in an environment where anonymous voting is used.
CwabMan: 
I concur with Atiera but I believe if we put enough effort in it we can do it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
But I don't see why the voting delegate can't react to a message to show they have voted without specifying their vote.
And then the Chair can check the numbers and see if there are two or three votes from one nation.
There's no need for specific Primary delegate roles.

Next up we'll be discussing the Noted! Project Phase 2.
Stand by
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If I may?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You have the floor.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A few days ago I stumbled upon this link which essentially covers a group which receives postcards from around the world and launches them into space. You may find the link here for further readnig: <a href="https://www.clubforfuture.org/missions/">https://www.clubforfuture.org/missions/</a>

Those present over the past two nights will know my feelings about the concept as I am strongly in support of launching a postcard to space at the end of the project.
I cede the floor.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Thank you. I open the floor to any delegates wishing to express their opinion on this proposal.
CwabMan: 
Once again, Humberlea is in full support of this project and may partake in it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let the record state that I am in support of this proposal and think it'd be a great project to boost activity.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
No comments from Wendatia.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
No comments from Novus Hierosolymis.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that the amount of support for this project clearly shows that this is a great idea and one that we should continue with.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Moving on then, next up we have the Cupertino Alliance Sister Cities Project. This is a proposal for the implementation of a Sister City project like the GUM (see here: <a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/GUM_Sister_Cities_Program)">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/GUM_Sister_Cities_Program)</a> for international cooperation and bolstering foreign affairs.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is in full support of this proposal.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
CwabMan: 
Once again, I think this is a good idea to bond our countries and grow connections so Humberlea is in full support of this proposal.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree. It's certainly a benefit to the activity and diplomatic benefits of the Alliance.
Just so long as it is kept active.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Atiera will likely participate if the project is implemented. I support the proposal.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia concurs.
CwabMan: 
Humberlea Concurs.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is in full support of this proposal.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is in concurrence.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would like that the project proposed highlights on various programmes initiated. I will like to point that in the GUM, the cities are nominally paired but there's not much activities.
CwabMan: 
Would all of a member nations cities have sister cities or just one?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It would be good if there's some pre-decided activities jotted down for the paired cities
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with the delegate from Vishwamitra.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
May I know which department will be handling the affairs?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Likely the <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(39, 126, 205); background-color: rgba(39, 126, 205, 0.1);">@Minister of Development and Interstate Cooperation</span>
From what I can tell.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Who is the Minister, pardon me for my lack of knowledge?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">It would be good if there's some pre-decided activities jotted down for the paired cities
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Is that Mr. Valentinus?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe he is MicroWiki.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="LamentTwice#6176">@LamentTwice</span>
Are there any further comments on this proposal?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
None from Waterside Park.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from Novus Hierosolymis.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Pardon, Mr. Martin?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe he is the Minister for MicroWiki Affairs, is what I meant to say, sorry.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
who is the Minister of Agreements.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
If the delegates agree with listing down and agreeing on the activities out of session prior to the pairing, I have no reasons to disagree with the minister's proposals.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Duly noted, Mr. Ross.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Moving on, we have the proposal of a digital summit.
When should we host it? What topics should said summit cover?
Any thoughts?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that we should host it well before the end of June for starters.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would suggest that the summit be hosted in the month of July
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
However we should plan it around the clean-up and other items which will take place sooner.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is no longer present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
And for said topics, I guess that cooperation between nations, micronationalism out of wiki, etc could be one of the finest examples of discussing.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe the session could be hosted towards late May.
If we plan effectively enough.
But early June may be a better choice.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As to my knowledge, I would request the authorities to invite HH Prince Phillip of Pibocip M.A., for a presentation of a thesis he has worked on which provides a good idea on micronations &amp; microstates.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that we should have guest speakers as well.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">As to my knowledge, I would request the authorities to invite HH Prince Phillip of Pibocip M.A., for a presentation of a thesis he has worked on which provides a good idea on micronations &amp; microstates.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We have the GUM summit coming up, so I believe it should not conflict.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Maybe we could have an informal time allocated at the end for informal discussion and games like Jackbox?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
If the authorities wish to remain within the wiki community, then I have nothing more to comment.
CwabMan: 
I think topics such as Ways to better your nations surrounding communities and How to make earth a better place through Micronationalism would be good topics. You could talk about how a Micronation can participate in things such as soup kitchens and how things like beach clean-ups are a good way to give your nation a good reputation and also make the planet cleaner.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I think any summit should be held on a weekend, maybe June 5/6, or the week after?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Wait, this gives me an idea
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I think topics such as Ways to better your nations surrounding communities and How to make earth a better place through Micronationalism would be good topics. You could talk about how a Micronation can participate in things such as soup kitchens and how things like beach clean-ups are a good way to give your nation a good reputation and also make the planet cleaner.
CwabMan: 
I concur with this idea as long as there is still a formal section of the summit.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We could cooperate with the GUM for a joint summit, which could also work to catapult the GUM-CA relations which have fallen inactive
CwabMan: 
I concur with Australis
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I did propose that we hosted a community-wide summit so perhaps we could merge the two?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The proposed GUM summit is mainly an Asia summit and it is a one that aims to unite the Aisan community
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
That would be an excellent idea.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I will be opposed to the Minister's proposal
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I also know that Brooke Kennedy has been planning a larger 24 hour Quorum
We could link that in?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I guess we could.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am the one who's planning the GUM summit, so I will remain opposed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
So long as it doesn't end up like the 69 hour session which it almost certainly won't.
CwabMan: 
I completely concur with Australis on the 24 hour quorum being linked.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Also I must quickly state my plans for events:
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Of which two of those are next in our agenda
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
So if we are to have an international digital event we should fit it somewhere after the clean-up and song contest.
<div class="quote">Of which two of those are next in our agenda
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Which we should move onto if there are no further questions?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
No further comments from Waterside Park.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, moving on we have a proposal for a Eurovision style contest in the CA.
Essentially, it's a music contest between members in which delegates send a song and participants vote for the best one (like this: <a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Microvision_Song_Festival)">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Microvision_Song_Festival)</a>
CwabMan: 
Humberlea is once again completely in support of this.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's a bit of a fun event and can encourage people to join the CA and enjoy themselves here.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I wish to enquire if this remains only between delegates or citizens from the member nations?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I feel like what Mr. Lycon said last night would be of worth to the conversation:
Chau Khang - A Gift to the People | State of Arpet / CrossRoads 2019</div>
<div class="quote">I wish to enquire if this remains only between delegates or citizens from the member nations?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I really enjoy the idea the idea of this proposal. This seems like a really fun way to let loose a little bit, and take a break from the formality that often comes with micronationalism.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
So, it needs only delegates to participate. Thank you.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I mean if citizens wish to participate then I see no reason why they can't?
CwabMan: 
I concur with Aenopia.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur as well.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It is not possible for me to appoint any more delegates, secondly some are out of discord, like in real life who would sing.
Will the competition only accept English songs?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Any songs so long as they are appropriate I guess.
CwabMan: 
I believe any language should be allowed.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree.
CwabMan: 
Including music without words.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Including music without words.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Don't you have an album of instrumentals, Mr. Ross?
CwabMan: 
What are these obvious reasons?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed I do however the point of a song contest is that it would be about singing would it not?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Do you mean performances of the instrumentals?
CwabMan: 
Vocal cords are just another instrument.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Humming along to an instrumental wouldn't really count I suppose.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Do you mean performances of the instrumentals?
CwabMan: 
I ment the instruments only.
Alright then.
Could the singing be accompanied by instruments?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think that'd be a great idea!
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
And can multiple performers from a nation form a bit of a band for the contest?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That would almost certainly be interesting.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">And can multiple performers from a nation form a bit of a band for the contest?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Can we have discussions on the songs, music, etc out of the official records of the session?
CwabMan: 
Indubitably Heinous.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Sorry, Mr. Rallis?
CwabMan: 
In a good way as in.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Shall we move on, Mr. Speaker?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes, I was just getting the information for the next proposal.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next up is a proposed CA Clean-up event.
Mr. Ross, I understand you proposed this initially?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park completely supports this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed I did.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Would you like to give us an explanation for some of your thoughts?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed, I'll just find my notes quickly.
Last year we planned to host an environmental clean-up, however this was cancelled due to the restrictions regarding COVID.
CwabMan: 
Once again, Humberlea is in complete support of this event.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Considering now that we can undertake this due to the relaxing of restrictions, I believe that it would be a great opportunity to not only clean up the territories of member states, but also preserve our environments.
We also planned to partner with the GUM on this, however they rejected this last year. Considering the fact that GUM-CA relations are much better now, it might be a good idea to invite them to join?
I cede.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis supports this, but may not be able to participate due to lack of greenery where I do reside.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It all depends on which regions we're in.
For example, my home region has actually gone into lockdown recently, which makes it harder to do this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed, which means that we might have to push it back to sometime in May.
CwabMan: 
What if the event was more of a long term thing, nations do the event whenever they can in a large time period.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
 decides to carry out the activity in Cangun Llus
CwabMan: 
Such as may-august.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
My home region may enter into strict lockdown and also the cases are rising high in India
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'd prefer that sort of thing possibly.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Vishwamitra may not be able to participate until @Logan Ross - Aenopia  decides to carry out the activity in Cangun Llus
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That is truly good to know.
I have been visiting Bryn Glaw almost everyday now, it is also cleaned up.
CwabMan: 
What is Cangun Llus if you do not mind me asking?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Cangun_Llus">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Cangun_Llus</a>
Cangun Llus</div>
Cangun Llus, officially known as the Overseas Territory of Cangun Llus, is a Vishwamitran overseas territory located in Northern England. The territory was annexed as a part of the Treaty of Land Exchange signed between the State of Vishwamitra and the Empire of Aenopia on 18 February 2021. As a part of the exchange, Bryn Glaw was annexed by A...</div>
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
A region of Vishwamitra.
CwabMan: 
Intresting.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's a Vishwamitran territory located in the UK next to Aenopia.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Onto the topic at hand
Are there any more comments on how we can organise another cleanup event?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me as well.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We now move onto the proposed ERIE system.
This was a key part of the Ross-Xia manifesto, and is a landmark safeguarding system.

CwabMan: 
Once again, Humberlea is in full support of this system.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Something important that Mr. Valentinus highlighted is that the system would face some serious issues due to the lack of CA-GUM cooperation.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Refer to page 16
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Can someone provide some idea on the ERIE system?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
See page 15-17 of the above manifesto.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The ERIE system is well thought out, and I don't see why there should be a single vote against it.
CwabMan: 
I concur.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur. I think this is absolutely necessary to maintain a safe Alliance.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Due to certain reaasons, the link is not working for me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Regional block?
Unfortunately the publisher made it impossible to download the PDF so I can't send it to you.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
CwabMan: 
Intresting.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Stand by
CwabMan: 
Standing by.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is no longer present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
will be taking over for the remainder of the session.
CwabMan: 
Indeeed.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Our first membership application is the Second reading for the Republic of Kranoya

CwabMan: 
Thank you.
Ah yes, Humberlea believes this nation is too new and does not have enough information to be in the Alliance yet.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They seem very young.
Abstain at best from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am ready, I could carry on.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Excellent. Thank you.
Have a good day all. Australis is no longer present.
Adios.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I will taking over for the rest of the session.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Good evening.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I wish to know if any delegate has anything to comment on the application of Kranoya.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will be abstaining on this nation as well.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Duly noted.
I too feel that they should focus more on internal matters for now.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I will abstaining on their application.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
I concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
They seem to only have a Discord server.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They have a website, if I am not wrong.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The lack of MicroWiki page is also detrimental to their cause.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
<a href="http://kranoya.rf.gd/">http://kranoya.rf.gd/</a>
CwabMan: 
Yes yes, The Website in my opinion is very good but otherwise theres not much going for them.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Well we cant' justify anything because of the lack of MicroWiki page though, it is not mandatory to have a wikipage
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
The website looks good.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Are people from the applicant nation on the server?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Well we cant' justify anything because of the lack of MicroWiki page though, it is not mandatory to have a wikipage
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I think we might speak to them and know about their nation once.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
But I think they still need more development.
CwabMan: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
And MicroWiki pages are usually the best source about a nation.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They have a website, I think that would suffice if we look for information.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">But I think they still need more development.
It might be worth redirecting them to the CASC.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would need to disagree with you on this point.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
MicroWiki or not, they’re simply too new in my opinion. I wouldn’t be voting in favor regardless.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra did not have a wikipage for 13 yrs.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with my fellow delegate from Atiera.
Any further comments?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe, we could move on.
The next application is on:
The Soyuzist Republic</div>
The Soyuzist Republic is a self declared country , also referred to as a micronation by external observers. It works on the basic principles of Soyuzism. The nation was established on 30 April 2020, by the founder and current Prime Minister Hicham Soyuz. 
CwabMan: 
Once again, Humberlea believes we should allow this nation into our alliance.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their page isn't too bad actually.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As part of the Vishwamitran delegation, I would support their admission into the alliance.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that by making them observers we could help them grow a bit.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I worked a bit on their page on the request of their leader.
CwabMan: 
Yes and once they grow even more we can let them in as a full delegate.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Well, observership is just for two-three weeks, iirc
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed.
CwabMan: 
Oh ok.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Any further comments?
CwabMan: 
not from humberlea.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from Waterside Park.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
If there is no more discussion on this nation, I feel like we should adjourn in five minutes, unless anybody has any proposals.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
OK
CwabMan: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Excellent session I guess, 1 hour 21 minutes, a lot got done

<div class="quote">Are observers allowed to praticipate in the project.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
alright.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything before we move on?
Alright then we shall move onto the next item.
It has come to my attention that the headquarters of the Cupertino Alliance are located in Point Cupertino in Aenderia.
Now there are a few issues with this.
For starters, Aenderia is no longer a member state.
Secondly, most of us understand what's going on with Aenderia at this moment in time including far-right ideologies.
With that said, I propose that we move the headquarters of the Cupertino Alliance to another location.
brooke &#128158;: 
Mr. Chair?
CwabMan: 
What is going on in Aenderia?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The floor is open to discussion.
<div class="quote">Mr. Chair?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Question, would we need the change the name if we move from Cupertino Point.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I personally believe the CAHQ should be moved to a zone that is not officially part of any member state, and is instead shared.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">What is going on in Aenderia?
<div class="quote">Question, would we need the change the name if we move from Cupertino Point.
As far as I'm aware, Point Cupertino was named after the Alliance.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
brooke &#128158;: 
Thank you. As Cupertino Carl, I think it would be important for the Cupertino Alliance to find a new headquarters as opposed to Point Cupertino. If the Cupertino Alliance is to live up to the Cupertino name, however, we must find an appropriate venue to keep the Cupertino spirit alive and well. Cupertino Carl therefore suggests that the Cupertino Alliance search for a new place with the name Cupertino for our headquarters. Perhaps Cupertino, California?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I personally believe the CAHQ should be moved to a zone that is not officially part of any member state, and is instead shared.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
There is an enclave within Waterside Park Park which is not claimed, but I do maintain.
It's a former playground which is now long gone.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

brooke &#128158;: 
Mr. Chair, I’m not sure what your implication is.
Just because I’m Cupertino Carl doesn’t mean I’m a Cupertino joke.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Cupertino Carl therefore suggests that
Back on topic, where would the headquarters be located though?
brooke &#128158;: 
Cupertino?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes but we actually need to be able to support the claim that goes with it.
CwabMan: 
Perhaps we should find a Place were there is a large amount of nations of the Alliance and pick somewhere near there.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Does anyone have access to unclaimed land which is maintainable?
I'm an observer, so that might be a problem to use land near me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Maybe Cupertino, CA?
CwabMan: 
What if we just went to Aenderia and just kinda stepped in
brooke &#128158;: 
Again speaking as Cupertino Carl, I think the good people of Cupertino, California wouldn’t be opposed to the Cupertino Alliance making Cupertino our Cupertino Alliance headquarters
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would suggest maintaining a territory as part of an external body which is operated by member states.
<div class="quote">What if we just went to Aenderia and just kinda stepped in
brooke &#128158;: 
A Cupertino Condominium?
CwabMan: 
It would solve this problem and also have one less nazi in the community.
Oh ok.
Never mind then.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I have the perfect bit of land for that. Is it a problem that I'm an observer and not a full member, though?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">A Cupertino Condominium?
<div class="quote">I have the perfect bit of land for that. Is it a problem that I'm an observer and not a full member, though?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is intermittently present.
CwabMan: 
Do we have a map of all member states as that would be helpful for this.
brooke &#128158;: 
I’m Cupertino Carl and I support a Cupertino Condominium to serve as the Cupertino Headquarters for the Cupertino Alliance, so long as this Cupertino Condominium is actually located in a place named Cupertino
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I have a better idea.
brooke &#128158;: 
Such as Cupertino, California
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I’m Cupertino Carl and I support a Cupertino Condominium to serve as the Cupertino Headquarters for the Cupertino Alliance, so long as this Cupertino Condominium is actually located in a place named Cupertino
brooke &#128158;: 
That’s my name, Mr. Chair.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr. Lycon, could you just remove this land from Aenderia? As far as I know, it is sort of under your jurisdiction via the Ponderosan protectorate.
brooke &#128158;: 
I think it’s highly inappropriate that you would imply I should not use my pseudonym.
CwabMan: 
I concur with the Carl but I believe that it would be hard to do it in Cupertino California.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
You know fully well that it's not about pseudonyms.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I’m close to Cupertino, CA.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Is that the old Apple HQ on the left?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I think this whole proposal is just a bit silly, to be honest.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Sorry, off topic.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Even then, should we really claim the headquarters of an international company as our headquarters?
It seems very unprofessional.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Another alternative we could consider is removing the requirement for a physical headquarters of the CA.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Jayden controls Point Cupertino. If you don't want an Aenderian headquarters, you'll need to have a word with him.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The land I maintain but don't claim is roughly 950 square feet. (90-ish metres squared)
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
A number of micronational organizations operate without physical headquarters, so doing so wouldn't be unprecedented.
brooke &#128158;: 
I won’t stand for this disrespect, Mr. Chair. I’ll not be your punching bag.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">@Logan Ross - Aenopia Jayden controls Point Cupertino. If you don't want an Aenderian headquarters, you'll need to have a word with him.

I am Cupertino Carl.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
And I'm bored of these silly games.
CwabMan: 
where is Aenopia?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I ask the honourable delegate of Ponderosa Hills, if they are acquainted with GUM Gary?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Northern England (mostly).
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Primarily the United Kingdom.
CwabMan: 
Oh nevermind then.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I ask the honourable delegate of Ponderosa Hills, if they are acquainted with GUM Gary?
CwabMan: 
But yes why not just, Take it?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
We don't need to change headquarters. This has no point, and you should have spoken to the former chairman about it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we'll move on.
Next up we have discussion regarding the management of the Voting system.
As you may have seen, we recently passed the National Voting act, which limits voting to an individual nations rather than delegates.
However we cannot currently moderate this with our current voing bot as far as I'm aware.
The floor is open to discussion.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is no longer present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
How should we moderate this method of voting then?
We cannot check each vote individually however do we just trust that people would communicate with their delegates?
Do we assign roles to the primary head of each delegation?
CwabMan: 
I think that is a good idea.
The roles part as in.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park will not comment on this topic.
CwabMan: 
But we would want to allow primary delegates to allow secondary delegates vote for a specific bill if a primary delegate cannot attend a session.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe the current system of using Pollmaster may need to cease, as it would be difficult with this new system.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I think we should return to using the old reaction votes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I think we should return to using the old reaction votes.

Alright we'll move onto an announcement regarding the Cupertino Guides.
The Guides has recently moved from the mainspace on MicroWiki to guides.micronations.wiki.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
See article 5.
Charter of the Cupertino Alliance, 2020</div>

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm not too sure about the communication regarding the changeover; numerous delegates in the GUM have voiced their opinions against the move, citing it as hostile.
Indeed not even I was aware of the changeover.
Other than that I believe that it'll be a welcome change to the previous location.
Anybody wish to add anything before we move on?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Yes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wish to note that currently, there is an internal administrative discussion on the future of the guides subdomain. Therefore, there is a possibility of news in future to conclude this matter.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Originally I asked Luxor and Austenasia about moving the Cupertino Guide to the guides.micronations.wiki, considering:
There has been some discussion about changing the name to MicroWiki Guides, I am neutral on this, considering that a lot is cited as Cupertino Guide and the Cupertino Guide term has been used. However, per the attribution agreement on CC BY-SA, the Cupertino Alliance should be mentioned.
I yield
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
Any further discussion before we move on?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I do have something related to the guides but not related to said issue
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Our final item for this evening before we move onto applications is the suspension of Brooke Kennedy for consistent breached of decorum. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a-_mK1npTTl0AZtBN860ClC4mDN1IZAZZE5mCCI9ep8/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1a-_mK1npTTl0AZtBN860ClC4mDN1IZAZZE5mCCI9ep8/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Technically this isn't a motion but more of a discussion before I enact it.
The floor is open to discussion.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
An indefinite suspension seems a bit too far
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Apologies it should say 2 weeks.
CwabMan: 
If its for 2 weeks I support the suspension of the Carl but does her nation have any other delegates?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Leon Montan
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Johann Kummel as well.
Technically she's the tertiary delegate of Ponderosa Hills as well so it shouldn't be detrimental to the member state.
CwabMan: 
Ah I see.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If I recall correctly, I believe they were recently suspended from the Desert District delegation for reasons similar.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed but she was expelled by the delegation of Desert District.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am aware.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from Waterside Park.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright moving onto applications.

The floor is open to discussion.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Their website looks phenominal
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They lack a MicroWiki page, however their website is good.
I'd be willing to support them if it gives them a chance to create a MicroWiki page.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Quite young, but they are definitely a good applicant. They are also quite frequently found on r/micronations.
CwabMan: 
I have no opinion on this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Alright then moving on.
The Soyuzist Republic
The Soyuzist Republic</div>
The Soyuzist Republic is a self declared country , also referred to as a micronation by external observers. It works on the basic principles of Soyuzism. The nation was established on 30 April 2020, by the founder and current Prime Minister Hicham Soyuz.

They don't look too bad actually.
I'd be willing to support them as members.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
78 members on their discord is quite high for a micronation.
They seem well established.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
I do also concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their MicroWiki page isn't too bad either.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that they would be good observers.
They also seem to have their own wiki which provides more information: <a href="https://the-soyuzist-wiki.wikidot.com/">https://the-soyuzist-wiki.wikidot.com/</a>
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Interesting
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Actually scratch that it doesn't provide a huge amount of information.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything else before we conclude for this evening then?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The Cupertino Guide Chapter 2 is nearly finished. We pre-included assignments that people can choose to do for a barnstar, would the Cupertino Parliament wish to fully and formally integrate those barnstars into the award system? 
Ideally, a ministerial order can work.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I inquire as to the details of these barnstars?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Inspired by wikipedia: <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Barnstars</a>
Wikipedia:Barnstars</div>
It is the custom to reward Wikipedia contributors for hard work and due diligence by awarding them a barnstar. To give the award to someone, just place the image on their talk page, and explain why it was given. If you are sure the barnstar is appropriate, don't be shy!
A nice award to motivate people
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I meant the Cupertino variants..
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Otherwise I'd be in support of the implementation of barnstars.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Basically that but divided into three awards:
The barnstar will come with a certificate to certify it
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This is the first I am hearing of this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Sounds interesting - a bit more than the bog standard wiki awards.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It's to be signed by the Minister of MW Affairs considering its apart of the ministry (though I dm'ed you yesterday night about it)
CwabMan: 
Yes seems intresting.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anything else worth discussing before we conclude for tonight?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
One more thing
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Should the Cupertino Alliance host cultural exchanges where a nation goes to another participanting nation's Discord server to host an expo? These expos can showcase things about the visiting nation, their diplomatic relations, games, culture, etc.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
No.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
A centralized management system could be better for marketing and logistics
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It seems like it could potentially be a safeguarding concern if a younger delegate meets with an older one.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Good point
CwabMan: 
indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Is that all people wish to add?
CwabMan: 
Nothing from humberlea.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then that concludes this evening's session.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Thank you.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

No

Alright let's begin with the Twin Towns project.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qaflana present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Last night I announced that applications would close following the 77th session, and I would announce the results this evening.
To stay true to this, here are the groups in which participating cities have been grouped into.
<img loading="lazy" class="emoji " alt="🟦" title="blue_square" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f7e6.svg"> Group A:
Each group represents the partners of each city - if a city is located within a group then it means that it has been paired with every city within the group.
later, however if people want a formal document to complement this then I'll oblige.
Anybody wish to add anything before we continue?
CwabMan: 
Humberlea has nothing to add.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Alright we'll move onto an announcement regarding the Cupertino Guides.
The Guides has recently moved from the mainspace on MicroWiki to guides.micronations.wiki.
This is what I said last night, which would add to this discussion:
The floor is open to discussion.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" style="color: rgb(94, 197, 171); background-color: rgba(94, 197, 171, 0.1);">@Members</span>
CwabMan: 
Why would GUM think its hostile?
It is just guides, why is it changing hostile.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
guides.micronations.wiki was initially the host of the GUM Guides, which was inactive and saw no updates for years.
CwabMan: 
Ah I see.
What are the guides for?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The wiki admins authorised the move over to MicroWiki Guides, however the GUM were not alerted to this and so have taken it as being hostile.
CwabMan: 
Like what do they guide us to do.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The GUM laid inactive on their project for nearly 2 years if I’m not mistaken. It is my belief that they had no intentions of picking the project back up, and are only upset because someone got to it. 
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
MicroWiki has no problem naming it GUM Guides but has one when its named Cupertino Guides
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't think it helps that almost all of the wiki admins, and indeed the site owner himself, are members of the GUM.
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
CwabMan: 
Why do we not open our own wiki?
James B. - Desert District: 
That’s on them though.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Server costs
CwabMan: 
Ah I see.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
And I am not going to use Wikia
James B. - Desert District: 
Not our fault, we have the ability to keep it active and they don’t, it’s that simple.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We could run it via Miraheze if we wanted to.
I tried (unsuccessfully) to create an Aenopian wiki in the past using Miraheze and it wasn't too bad actually.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Cross wiki links though
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
The Guides issue seems like a warrantless attack against the CA from the GUM.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I can attest to the fact that Mirahese is a good wiki host.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Cross wiki links though
<div class="quote">The Guides issue seems like a warrantless attack against the CA from the GUM.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
They call us a joke while blocking everything they can to help us develop.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean when you're teaching others using external links isn't optimal
CwabMan: 
Why do the CA and GUM seem to hate each other so much?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
It is just a renewal of useless fighting between the two organizations, that they are completely starting.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Why do the CA and GUM seem to hate each other so much?
It's mostly the ultra-old guard that's the issue.
If Jack Dean hadn't become Chair then I doubt that they'd even be interested in speaking to us, let alone criticising us.
CwabMan: 
I see.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think this is on topic, but I am not sure. I am proposing to stop work on cooperation with the GUM.
It seems completely useless and a waste of time as they obviously think of us as just a thorn in their side.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Sadly I agree with this, which brings me onto my next item.
I'll just wait until everyone's concluded.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
As a member of both organizations, I personally don’t have any issues regarding the Cupertino Guides being moved to guides.microwiki.com
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then, moving onto my next motion.
Next up I propose that we start to initiate discussion with Asian organisations including AIM, ASPAA and ASAAM.
CwabMan: 
I think that is a wonderful idea.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Millan and ASPAA are both great, though I am not sure about the others. I would welcome back our old founding member.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Millan and ASPAA are both great, though I am not sure about the others. I would welcome back our old founding member.
CwabMan: 
Who is our old founding member?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Nicolas Millan, apart of former Millania
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Mr. Roy of Vishwamitra has connections with ASAAM which will make things a lot easier regarding discussion.
CwabMan: 
Oh intresting.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Expelled due to inactivity
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Which is one of my concerns about re-admitting them.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Post-regional sessions, I would be happy re-admitting them
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
How do we not know that they won't be inactive again?
CwabMan: 
Thats ashame, Humberlea will not be present for around 2 minutes but ill be back.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I suppose it is advisable to appoint a secondary delegate
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I suppose it is advisable to appoint a secondary delegate
From what I've heard, AIM may not be as active anymore due to the Indonesian shock of last year.
This also begs the question of should we continue with organisational cooperation internationally?
CwabMan: 
Humberlea is back.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Whilst we're working with these Asian organisations, would it not make sense to reach out to other regional organisations such as the UMCE or the Conference of Santiago or NADU?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
ASPAA and maybe Union of Micronations of Central Europe maybe good since their leaders are experienced and in the same community
And that they are in zones that don't have much members
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We can take what we lean from discussions with ASPAA and use it to spread internationally.
<div class="quote">And that they are in zones that don't have much members
That's one of the primary focuses of international cooperation really.
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on then?
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I remember there being a French-language organization, not sure where it went, though should we attempt to start cooperation? We will need to appoint a french lieutenant though
My Quebecois French is not very good
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
There was a french-oriented organisation if I remember correctly but I cannot remember the name.
I believe that one of the primary languages of Northwood-Oregon is French, so that might be a good call for a French lieutenant?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Perhaps
CwabMan: 
Indeed.

MicroFrancophonie</div>
The MicroFrancophonie, OMF (Organisation for MicroFrancophony), is a micronational organisation founded on the 30 of May 2015 with the purpose of promoting harmony between francophone micronationalists. The OMF wants to be a handy tool for its members. It was first initiated by the Autonomous Province of Valinois—Saint-Castin and the Principalit...</div>
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Very interesting
Just a question
What Ministry should this fall under?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Minister of Agreements &amp; Developments perhaps?
Maybe the Minister of Public Affairs?
CwabMan: 
I agree with the Agreements and Developments ministrying doing this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If it's within a certain region e.g. ASPAA then we could pair it with the respective Regional Minister.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yeah
Perhaps opening a standing committee just to centralize everything
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Perhaps opening a standing committee just to centralize everything
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think your French capabilities plus Google Translate should be fine if there is not a member of MicroFrancophonie that speaks English.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean an agency might be better as it is permenant
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thank you
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
but I respectfully disagree
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I think your French capabilities plus Google Translate should be fine if there is not a member of MicroFrancophonie that speaks English.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
After a bit of research, Sandus is a member, and they are a primarily Anglophone nation.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Burdette is present.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I also think that we should have an International Ministry or something along those lines for cooperation and the like.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Might it be worth inviting them to the CA as a representative-of-sorts to MicroFrancophonie?
<div class="quote">I also think that we should have an International Ministry or something along those lines for cooperation and the like.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
A moment late, but Mr. Ross is right that French is one of our official languages.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It might we worth merging the Minister of Agreements &amp; Developments into the International Ministry?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I think Public Affairs could do that.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Home Office agency under Public Affairs?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
If this Ministry is created, I am willing to forego my Membership Minister status to be the International MInister.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Public Affairs is more press-centered, no?
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Expand that to foreign relations?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
International and Public Affairs?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Possibly
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Would it also be worth handing over responsibilities of the Noted project to the International Ministry?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Maybe
CwabMan: 
Perhaps.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Noted project right now is kind of apart of the Executive
CwabMan: 
Hmm, Indeed indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Nay.
CwabMan: 
Humberlea has nothing to add.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think that press and foreign relations should be kept separate.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall move onto the final item for this evening.
As the National voting Act was recently published, we are going to need to completely rethink the way that we conduct voting.
This of course includes how we'll moderate it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It's going to be tough
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Therefore the floor is open to discussion on how we can moderate implement national voting into the CA - it's great that the bill has passed however we still need to implement it.
<div class="quote">It's going to be tough
CwabMan: 
Make it so we cannot see voting channel unless we are primary delegate then continue with the bot we use right now?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We might have to move over to a new Discord bot in replacement of Pollmaster, as we cannot current moderate individual votes with the bot.
<div class="quote">Make it so we cannot see voting channel unless we are primary delegate then continue with the bot we use right now?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That defeats the point of having more then one delegate.
CwabMan: 
Ah i see.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If the primary delegate isn't available, then nobody can vote.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean should we officialize this with a new charter?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed we should.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I suppose Hamilton's bill can be a government is mandated to do it in the future
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
The bill did officialize it didn't it?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
How do we enforce it?
It's going to take time to think about that
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
How it said to enforce it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean like the system (i.e. what to do with Pollmaster, what Discord permissions, marketing to gain awareness)
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think our best option for now is to continue with the current system until we can come up with a suitable replacement for the old system.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't think we legally can.
Since it's law binding isn't it?
CwabMan: 
Fair point.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I guess ask the Superior Judge? Reference re National Voting Act
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If we just throw it aside that's setting a dangerous precedent.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Well then we'll have to repeal the bill until we can actually use it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
We can 
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Would we have to use the new method of voting to repeal it?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
What's the grounds for striking it down?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thats for the Superior Judge to decide
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Would we have to use the new method of voting to repeal it?
Which means that we would be stuck in a loop.
<div class="quote">Thats for the Superior Judge to decide
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
We can just do it how it says to do it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That could be abused
Or
CwabMan: 
But then you can see who voted.
ANd that is not allowed.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That too
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
But not how they voted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes you can
CwabMan: 
Yes, Hovering over the reaction shows it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Maybe
Make the voting hall only primary delegate?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If they just react to a separate message you won't be able to see how they voted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It is a pain in accessability but its the only feasible solution
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That creates issues with the Lemming effect.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Could someone please send the Charter?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Maybe we should do a Google Form for each vote for the forseeable future?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Thank you.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Pain in accessibility and bureaucratic resources but its the only one that can work
CwabMan: 
Humberlea must go now, Sorry for the early departure.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thank you for attending
There could also be confusion on what is a primary delegate
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Until we figure out a long term solution I guess that'll have to be how we vote I guess?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
a) Ask the Superior Judge to review it
The bill is short sighted unfortunately
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We'll go with Option A for now until we receive a verdict.
Then we'll go with Option B.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't see what the Superior Judge can do.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
We don't lose anything if we try
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I have a very large loophole that could work. It could be repealed by an official vote only de facto open to one or two nations, after there has been an informal vote to repeal it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I don't like that to be honest
Discrimintory
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
How?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
How would we decide which nations get to vote?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
So you want to lock out many nations from voting?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Do we draw a name from a hat?
<div class="quote">So you want to lock out many nations from voting.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That seems extremely unfair.
If every nation gets one vote.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
There would be a vote to everyone that technically doesn't count, and after that there is a vote that would de facto only be open to a few nations.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The best thing we can do is <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_question">https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reference_question</a> honestly
Reference question</div>
In Canadian law, a reference question or reference case (formally called abstract review) is a submission by the federal or a provincial government to the courts asking for an advisory opinion on a major legal issue. Typically the question concerns the constitutionality of legislation.</div>
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
It is only unfair on paper.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Wait I'm confused, you want to have a vote that is only open to a few nations?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'll send in a request for the Supreme Judge to review the issue later, and until then we'll all have to come up with a decent short-term solution to repeal the act.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I'll be happy to do the paperwork
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If you so wish then feel free.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Did you read what I said? My proposal is to have a technically informal vote through Google Polls or something similar, and once there is an informal decision, there would be a formal vote that is only open for something like a minute that would just be a formality.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That would still be descrimitory.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
How?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Because the first vote isn't binding.
And if every nation gets a vote then you can't stop a nation from voting.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Isaiah, I’m not sure if you understand that this is a one time solution to a fairly major problem. This loophole wouldn’t be how the alliance votes permanently. 
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'm saying it's not a loophole.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
That makes no sense. Just because the first vote is non-binding doesn't mean it is discriminatory.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
It is intended to be a loophole, but ok.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd suggest putting it to a vote however we can't do that.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
You can't stop a nation from voting in a official vote right? Or do we legally have the power to just limit it to a few nations?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
The de jure vote could go on for a very short amount of period (like 30 seconds) so it would be de jure open to everyone.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further before we conclude for this evening?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That's not allowed under the charter.
After a session, all acts shall be placed into a vote. All normal legislation shall be done through a Discord reaction poll. All ministerial opinion polls, elections for any kind of seat, member attainment applications, as well as anything that the Chair deems that should be anonymous, should be conducted through an anonymous poll using a Discord bot service. Voting shall end after <strong>three (3) days</strong> or when a majority of fifty-one percent from all members of Parliament has been reached, and votes should be placed no later than twenty-four (24) hours after the ending of the session.
It can be shortened to one however
Under the Urgent Proposal Act
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anything else that people wish to add before we conclude?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
A couple things
Relating to the topic or session?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I guess we should go through the Supreme Court then.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
My discussion points do not relate to topic present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Relating to the topic or session?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please?
CwabMan: 
Humberlea is back.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
On 20 September 2020, my government released the Guide to announcing, hosting, and managing sessions, a guide in preparation for the Regional Sessions Act. Since then, the guide has been a vital resource within this alliance, and other nations can use it to host their parliamentary meetings.

Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I for one am in support of the renewal of this document as I can imagine that this could be a useful resource to other organisations.
Anybody wish to add anything else?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I also humbly ask the Executive to open a standing committee on ASPAA relations, considering the act to start them is still binding.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed I will be creating a standing committee following this session.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I also plan to integrate various projects, including the nature project and noted project on our website.
Former will focus on a showcase of parks, whilst the latter will be updates.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Speaking about nature projects I hope to restart the CAoNI project after its failed start earlier this year.
That'll be discussed during a later session though.
Unless anybody wishes to add anything further then this session has been adjourned.
Thank you to everyone who has attended this evening's session and a reminder regarding tomorrow's session at 14:00 UCT.
CwabMan: 
Thank you for leading this Session.

The 78th session is a Asian &amp;Oceanic Session scheduled to be hosted on 2 May...</div>
Australis is present.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Atiera is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is intermittently present.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We have a few members present and I'm sure more will show up, so I believe we should begin.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville will be barely present. I will likely be absent for a long period of time during this session.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The first item on our agenda is for the Cupertino Alliance to begin cooperation with several Asian organisations within the micronational community. This will benefit the Alliance by expanding our Asia sector, a part of the Alliance which is rather small.
Are there any comments on this proposal?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from Waterside Park.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nor from Atiera.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe that it will be beneficial to the Alliance.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If that is all for this topic, I say we move onto the next item of the agenda.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
OK
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Voting system management. As you all should know, the National Voting Act was recently passed, changing the way the Cupertino Alliance votes on proposals. However, this is difficult to enact with the current voting system we have. A provisional system was written into the Act which can be trialled, but in the long run we may need to move past Pollmaster.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Maybe each primary delegate votes with a Google Form? It might slow voting, however,
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This nation based voting system works in the GUM because voting is not anonymous, similar to the UN.
And many Parliaments, for that matter.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Surely, for transparency, votes shouldn't be anonymous?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If votes are anonymous it could mean more than one delegate votes on a proposal, creating an unfair voting advantage.
The question is, do we amend the charter for public voting?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Surely.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I do believe that things would be significantly easier if votes weren’t anonymous. Amending the charter may be necessary, in my opinion.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It would be necessary to amend it.
I think amendments to the Charter for this is the best course of action.
CwabMan: 
Humberlea is now present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is present.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
A lot of concurrences.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I support amending the section of the charter concerning membership applications.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Excellent. Considering we have a consensus, shall me move on?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
No.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Yes
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe this should be marked as an urgent proposal, we need to resolve this as soon as possible to keep orderly and prevent stagnation of activity here.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree. It's something that truly is urgent.
Amendments should be discussed as an urgent proposal at the next session.
Will that be all?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Nothing else from Waterside Park.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from Atiera either.
CwabMan: 
Nothing from humberlea.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Right. Next up is the proposed move for the Cupertino Guide to the domain <a href="https://guides.micronations.wiki">https://guides.micronations.wiki</a>.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Fully in support.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is no longer present.
CwabMan: 
Humberlea is in full support.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Oh, it's already happened.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Not quite.
The issue with this proposal currently is that an already existing agreement with the GUM and MicroWiki for this domain, dating back two years.
However, despite the fact the GUM have not used this domain in two years, there have been rising tensions as a result of this.
It is because of this that I believe that the Cupertino and GUM Guides should exist separately, but they should co-exist as two different editions of guides on the guides subwiki.
Are there any alternate ideas, proposals or suggestions?
Any comments on the matter?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from Waterside Park.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Yes.
Sander I - Revalia: 
As an observer, Revalia remains neutral on that matter.
CwabMan: 
Why don't we just ignore the GUM and just transition.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The ball is not in our court here. This is a matter for the Wiki Administration to discuss, there is nothing we can do as of now but wait.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree with this. It's not really something we can do anything about, except suggest ideas to the wiki administration.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
That may be the best course of action, but it does frustrate me in some capacity. The GUM clearly had no intentions of using it, and are only upset because we are. But, if GUM and CA relations are to be strengthened, allowing them both to exist may be necessary.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Although personally I do think both guides being separate but co-existent on the guides website is a good idea.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur. I think it would be best to do so.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If it were me in charge, I would have the Guides subdomain used as a catch-all for all guides, for everyone to use and contribute.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I wholly concur with the Honourable Gentleman for West Sayville.
Honourable Delegate.
Anyway
If there is no more discussion, we move into 10 minutes for any proposals by delegates not in the agenda, following which we shall adjourn.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is no longer present.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Nothing from Revalia.
CwabMan: 
Nothing from Humberlea.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from Novus Hierosolymis.
CwabMan:

The floor is open to discussion.
I'm not sure how I exactly feel about this - it makes more sense to have them during sessions when everybody has convened to discuss items.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I quite like the current system.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think this is a great idea and will greatly speed up the membership applications.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that we'd be better off keeping the same membership system simply because it bulks smaller sessions - take for example last week's sessions.
Also it is worth adding that the membership part of the session always seems to draw more activity, which is beneficial to the session overall.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
May I comment on that?

<div class="quote">In my personal opinion, longer sessions do not mean better sessions. If there is a longer session, because the membership applications are at the end, I believe it draws delegates away from participating. In short, If a session is already long, we don't need to make it longer.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
May I?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
CwabMan: 
Humberlea is present.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I do not support this act for a variety of reasons.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Session lengths are indeed getting shorter, not that that's necessarily a bad thing though.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I also concur.
I feel the system we have now is good.
CwabMan: 
I concur too.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The M(R)A 2020 has been effective for our current purpose. There is no reason to amend it as of right now.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
None other than I wish the best of luck to Mr. Hamilton on the passing of this bill.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright moving swiftly on then.
Next up we have CA-sponsored website subdomains.
If you would wish to speak on this subject?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes please
May I have the floor
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Of course.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thank you
This system, if fund raised, can provide many exciting and developmental benefits to one's micronation. It allows a micornation to be viewed way more professional, considering it is not based on an .xyz or have a lot of numbers that would even make my maths teacher scared. This program will also allow for increased security and website speeds considering it is hosted on an solid state drive + premium SSL .
I yield
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
CwabMan: 
I support this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The floor is open to discussion.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is no longer present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It does seem like a very pricey endeavour however I believe that it would be possible to fund this and could potentially be a very popular addition to the Alliance.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Will this project be managed by the Ministry of Technology?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes, note though that you will be granted an FTP account which will allow you to access your subdomain.
There is also weekly backups by the hosting service for achiving and recovery purposes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Will members be able to seamlessly move over all of the content from their previous site?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
And I did see mentions of a custom email address, is this still possible?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">And I did see mentions of a custom email address, is this still possible?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
All depends on what the website contains. We hope that raw HTML and Wordpress sites would be able to transition easily considering
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes. It will be under Hostinger's email service but you can manage it through Gmail, Windows Mail, etc.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Thank you.

Alright then next up we have the re-establishment of the North Lincolnshire Project.

North Lincolnshire Program</div>
North Lincolnshire Program ELEVENTH DAY OF APRIL 2020 (11 April 2020)  After the success of the New Eiffel Seal redesign, it was noticed that some of the member nation’s seals and coat of arms are not that great.

Some of you may recall the North Lincolnshire Program which designed CoAs, flags, etc. for member states.
CwabMan: 
Humberlea is in full support of this.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Yes, of course. This program designed Atiera's first coat of arms.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
My proposal is that we formally restart the project under the guise of volunteers who specialise with digital design.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean this program is still live, what is to re-establish
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I remember being a recipient of this program under my tenure as Pinelandian delegate in May.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Instead of this being solely run by a ministry it would make more sense for volunteers to moderate and create designs.
<div class="quote">I mean this program is still live, what is to re-establish
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It has been dead since summer 2020 at the maximum.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The project still exists but it's dead in the water.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Regrettably, due to unforeseen circumstances, Atiera will no longer be present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Duly noted
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further regarding the North Lincolnshire project?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from Waterside Park
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I understand that digital graphic design can be challenging to those who aren't skilled with it so this could be very useful for members without digital expertise.
Next up we have the establishment/creation and subsequent merger of an International Ministry - essentially this would handle communications and cooperation with international organisations, which is becoming more important as we expand our reaches into the community with the likes of the CoS and GUM.
The floor is open to discussion.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Please excuse my sudden disapearence my power had gone out.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

Quite frankly we have ample ministries as it is and I don't believe that we need any more.

Anybody wish to add anything else?
Alright then moving onto applications.

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It's possible but I highly doubt that.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I highly doubt that statistic.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Last time the Gaplans came to the server they caused quite a debate so I'm interested on how they would do this time

Okay.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Talks have started but never lifted to anything
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Jack Dean has shown partial interest from time to time as part of his manifesto, however neither side has really compiled much.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I can't really support GUM partnership anymore due to my experiences in the server, the organization, as well as the general workspace.

Recently there has been quite a concerning comment by a GUM staff comparing what seems to be the opposition to Brooke Kennedy's behaviour here to nuremberg defence- that sealed my opposition. Though Dean did oppose I did not think enough was done.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Regarding the GUM talks, it is very clear neither party really knows exactly what it wants.. with talks amounting usually to let's... do stuff. We should draft a clear plan as to how to proceed, or just avoid wasting time with yet more failed talks.

I wish to quickly rewind to Mr. Lycons urgent proposal regarding the National Voting Act. I would like to know what said 'issues' are? The problems regarding membership applications have already been solved, both with the stopgap measure of the google forms, and the propositions to amend the charter for a more permanent and convenient solution.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thank you for your question. Delegates have concerns relating to privacy when they vote, thus reducing the amount of times these delegates vote. Furthermore, the system of voting through Google Forms is quite a hassle and would again, lead to less votes.

<div class="quote">Thank you for your question. Delegates have concerns relating to privacy when they vote, thus reducing the amount of times these delegates vote. Furthermore, the system of voting through Google Forms is quite a hassle and would again, lead to less votes.
Granted 12 votes isn't a huge amount and a drop by 3 votes isn't a disaster but it's still unhelpful for voting.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
To be fair, this is the first time that it has been used, and generally morale within the system decreases over time
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Other than that does anybody wish to add anything further before we wrap up for tonight?
I'm going to presume that's a no.

The floor is open to discussion.
I feel as if this act somewhat takes out the main focus of main sessions.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur. While good in theory, this seems like an unnecessary hassle in practice.
CwabMan: 
I believe this is not really a problem and if it isnt broken dont fix it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur with the Hon. delegate from Humberlea.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Any other opinions before moving on?
Alright moving on.
Next we have the discussion of Establishment of an International Ministry.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that Jayden Lycon suggested that we instead make the International Ministry a branch of the Ministry of Public Affairs.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think that would be great actually.
CwabMan: 
Yes I concur with the Hon. Delegate from Qaflana.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It would be easier to get more members from around the world.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">The International Ministry concept is mainly aimed as a medium for communication between the CA and other organisations like <span class="mention">#bcoa-standing-committee</span>.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Any other thoughts on this discussion?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I believe that it should be a separate ministry.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright moving on.
Next we have the discussion on CA-sponsored website subdomains.
I personally believe it is unneeded.
It is a cool project, no doubt about that but I can't think of us using it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I object
showed that there is interest
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
CwabMan: 
If it wouldnt be to expensive i would support it.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
We hope that the price can be subsidized with a fundraiser- members are already interested in donating
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It is $80 right?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
86 USD for 24 months
However it often goes on sale
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Like 86 a month for 24 months or 86 for the whole period?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Elabourate on whole period
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Like all 24 months.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Apologies for my short absence, but I would definitely support this. It would give many nations a boost in professionalism in the web sector, which is desperately needed by many.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Like the whole price.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
All 24 months then renews for 7USD per month
For 48 months, 111 USD then renews for 6USD
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I have mainly no opinion on it then.
CwabMan: 
The 48 months seems the best because while it is a lot of money at first its less than 3 dollars per month for 48 months then after that it is only 6 dollars which is a bit but who knows the state of the alliance by then.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry for being late, I am present under Humberlea.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah the most I'm worried about is what you brought up, the state of the alliance.
Like I have no doubt the alliance is thriving and such.
But I seem a bit uneasy about 4 year package.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Well, we can't really shut down since we will still be live at minimum as a premium domain organization
CwabMan: 
Good point.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I mean even if we get the 4 year package and the CA dissolves we'll still have archives of the websites of the member states and the organisation itself.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Any other opinions before we move on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana:

I heard it designed flags and such for different member states.

There is essentially no reason why to think otherwise in my opinion.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
May I have the floor?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
As part of our green-agenda within the Cupertino Alliance I was thinking of the creation of a series of Guides like the Cupertino Guides aimed towards growing plants and produce within member states - essentially it would contain information including the equipment and tools you'll need, tips and tricks to growing plants and crops before concluding with information regarding how to plant your own potatoes.
Then we can expand on the concept further in the future with other plants.
I cede the floor.
My idea is that it would be based on guides.micronations.wiki considering the fact that it's a Guides portion of MicroWiki.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That sounds like a great idea.
I wouldn't be opposed to this idea.
Remember the floor is open to discussion.

Gapla Remarks [2]</div>
Gapla Remarks TENTH DAY OF JULY 2020 (10 July 2020)  (continues <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1klG4x8b590MVI0ihVvJp5hHV5s7dvthkoNzqtyEqClU/edit?usp=sharing)">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1klG4x8b590MVI0ihVvJp5hHV5s7dvthkoNzqtyEqClU/edit?usp=sharing)</a>  A major problem with the previous application was the lack of LGBT rights. This has been fixed following efforts made by Christini...</div>
Here are their remarks.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah it's alright.
Wait they had the lack of LGBT+ rights?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I would like to apologize for not having updated remarks for Gapla and remarks and New Rubix.
However, I feel that MicroWiki and the like will suffice.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Yes.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The guy was impeached however though right?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
This policy has changed quite a while ago, but I am still iffy about this.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I am too.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I wouldn’t be opposed to their membership. However I’m not sure if I would vote to have them.
CwabMan: 
I am back.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Same.
I think if they were forgivable, they would put it in their history to look back on their mistake.
I mean atleast that to spread light on the oppression.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Based on what I’m seeing, I will likely abstain.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It is history none the less.
I am opposing to this nation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that there are far too many anti-LGBT nations in the community and I'd rather not potentially support another one.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
I think the CA should not involve themselves into anti LGBT stuff, and should just condone it and move on.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
There is one issue however.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That is?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Christina Nowell is apart of the LGBT community and apparently she lead the anti-oppression movement.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Australis is present. Sorry I couldn’t make it sooner.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
What..?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Monmark is present, and apologies for my absences; I am still battling a stomach bug.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Might be a reason why it isn’t in the history.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I will only say, as I have an appointment, punishing people for getting rid of bad laws, is dumb.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That is strange.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Now, I will excuse myself.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well it's less of punishing them, more that it seems iffy that it is not in history and such.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I should point by “one issue” I meant in your logic, not the fact Christina lead the anti-oppression movement.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, I guess so.
Any other opinions before we move on to our last nation?
Moving on.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
None here.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
New Rubix Republic

The New Rubix Republic, more commonly known as New Rubix, is a self-declared sovereign state more commonly referred to as a micronation by external observers. It is located in the South Eastern part of the Australian continent. The Republic has 9 citizens in a primarily local presence and is under a unitary military dictatorship with a President...</div>
There is no discord listed.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I’m in their server.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
You are?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Yes, if I may send the link?
CwabMan: 
They seem fairly good, I would support there Entry as a Observer.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, you may.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
<a href="https://discord.gg/qZ4GNwdt">https://discord.gg/qZ4GNwdt</a>
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, they can use some grease work on the wikipage, but a overall fit.
I am not opposed into having them as a member.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur as well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd be willing to give them a shot as Observers.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
And I must note, they have been around since 2015.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<a href="https://augustonpost.wordpress.com/">https://augustonpost.wordpress.com/</a>
Auguston Post</div>
The official news outlet of the New Rubix Republic!</div>
They seem to post articles fairly regularly as well by the looks of things.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will likely support their entry as observers.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I would as well. They seem like a good fit for the Cupertino Alliance
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, I support their entry aswell.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Any other opinions before we close out the 81st session?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright with that, I will be closing today's session.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Going back to the International Ministry plans, creating an entirely new ministry for it would be ridiculous. We already have a Ministry of Public Affairs.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
Are we going to do the thing about the nations news?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
What thing?
CwabMan: 
THis.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hmm.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed - if anybody wishes to release their statement then I'd advise saying so now.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is fine right now.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would ask, what purpose would this serve?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Not much from us.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I would ask, what purpose would this serve?
Doesn't mean it's going to be a thing in the future.
CwabMan: 
At the moment elections are going on in Humberlea, There are not many people running but by May 15 i expect more people.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I must concur. There’s already multiple outlets for member nations to share news about their nations, most of which are a better fit than in session times.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur Mr. Rallis.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Well then we shall leave it for tonight then.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
In Australis, by-elections are being held for the vacant seat in Amicita.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, no more talking until next session, take it to another chatroom.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we have an update on the guides?
This is an interesting point of contention between the Grand Unified Micronational and the Alliance, and it would be beneficial if we were kept up to date with news relating to such.
Additionally, continuing on from last session, do we have any updates with regards to GUM-CA co-operation? I would note that this has been brought up by the former organisation, and it is opportune that we lay out formal plans, expectations and benefits to what will become a monumental event in the alliances history, given our... well.. history.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Welcome, Mr. Lieutenant Chair.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
And on the topic of GUM-CA cooperation things have gone to a bit of a standstill, though the GUM Chair Jack Dean plans to invite several delegates from the respective organization to revitalise talks.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This is a start.
I must ask: alongside the joint eco-friendly project slated to occur upon our early collaborations, what else is planned for future?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I'm going to be honest I myself am a bit out of the loop having just returned from a three-week long break though if anyone else were to have any further knowledge this would be a time to share.
Cristian Dobrev - Plushunia: 
Plushunia is present
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Welcome, the delegate of Plushunia.
With that, my query is satisfied.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
From my knowledge though the only current planned piece of cooperation between the two organizations is the item you had mentioned, Mr. Sertor.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Is there any other business during this session to discuss?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright the session has ended again, please stop talking.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville:

Vishwamitra is present as well.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is intermittently present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I think we have enough members to move on.
Alright, the first on the agenda is the third reading on the Membership Reorganisation Act.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EPHs2joLiYTpEHl0re9TvLJCDcnQ8BvFQCIels86_bc/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1EPHs2joLiYTpEHl0re9TvLJCDcnQ8BvFQCIels86_bc/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Here's the bill; also the floor is open for discussion.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is present.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Personally, I am in opposition to this bill. Our system isn’t broken, no need to fix it and cause more hassle than necessary.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I am abstaining
CwabMan: 
I concur with the delegate from Atiera.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I shall be abstaining.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Personally I think, it is good for me to abstain as well; if we wish to change the system, we need to start from the beginning
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If I may quickly - Perhaps if this were to be established, it could go into the new charter instead? Like Mr. Roy said, start from the beginning.
Anyways, I'll be heading out now.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thanks for the comment, Mr. Hamilton.
I am not sure, if I am being super quick; however, I'd ask - Do anyone else have anything to comment to this?
CwabMan: 
Nothing from humberlea.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
In terms of the proposed bill, I am in opposition of it because if it aint broke, don't fix it.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Duly noted; Well, this the first full session I am hosting, so wish everyone cooperates.
If no one has any more to add, we could move on.
The next on the agenda is discussion regarding the establishment of an International Ministry
is present; would you like to speak on it?
And also, the floor is open for discussion.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As we begin to establish relations and form cooperations between other organisations including ASPAA and the GUM to name a few, some people believe that we should establish a separate body which handles the management and operation of these affairs.
I cede the floor.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Do we have a diplomacy related ministry?
Also, I must point that we do run with issues of over-bureaucracy
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Do we have a diplomacy related ministry?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am opposed to this.  This likely just another ministry that will fall inactive and increase bureaucratic red tape. The role that the Honorable Chair wishes to give this ministry could simply be given to the Ministry of Public Affairs.
CwabMan: 
I believe the International Ministry should be under the Public Affairs as a seperate department or as another purpose of Public Affairs.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Is Mr. Valentinus, the current Minister of Public Affairs?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I am opposed to this.  This likely just another ministry that will fall inactive and increase bureaucratic red tape. The role that the Honorable Chair wishes to give this ministry could simply be given to the Ministry of Public Affairs.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would urge the Chair to appoint someone much capable of handling talks and matters for the position if we are having a separate ministry.
CwabMan: 
Indeed.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Mr. Valentinus is the Minister of MicroWiki affairs. The Minister of Public Affairs is the honorable delegate from Saspearian, <span class="mention" title="Saspearian#0704">@Anthony I - Saspearian</span>
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Sorry for my lack of knowledge; I am not very sure if the said Saspearian delegate would be able to handle the stuffs.
But yes, these are out of session discussion; we must focus on whether we need the ministry.
CwabMan: 
We could have a seperate person under the Minister of Public Affairs have this job while not creating a new ministry.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I must concur with Mr. Rallis.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">We could have a seperate person under the Minister of Public Affairs have this job while not creating a new ministry.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Or else we rename the Pub. Aff. ministry as Ministry for Diplomatic and Public Relations?
It'd just serve out a dual purpose
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's an option.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright; do any one else have anything else to add to it?
I think we move on.
Next on the agenda is CA-sponsored website subdomains.
speaks on the topic.
CwabMan: 
I must leave now, Please excuse my early departure.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Duly noted.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Thank you. 
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would be opposed to that idea, as it would make the nations highly dependent on the organization and it may not be a great example for the sovereignty.
I don't the United Nations or the Commonwealth of Nations would create its own domains and ask the members to use it.
For get: www.govcanada.un or www.govcanada.cn
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would like to note that participation in this program is completely optional, and members may withdraw at any time.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would be opposed to this programme as the Vishwamitran delegate; and statement is not as per my office of the minister.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">I personally have no more to add to the subject, if you wish to continue <span class="mention" title="Dhrub#6459">@Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra</span>.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you Mr. Shepard; Do anyone else have anything to speak on the topic?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I think, we move on.
The next is: Re-establishment of the North Lincolnshire Project
The floor is open for discussion.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The North Lincolnshire project was a fantastic project when it was still around. Though it wasn’t the most active, allowing members to have the option to utilize it if they wish is a good idea. The program even designed Atiera’s first coat of arms. I would be delighted to see this project revived, and would even enjoy to participate.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
What are the purposes that serve under this project?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The project mainly focuses on graphic design, more specifically, designing flags and heraldic elements for member nations.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I think this would be a good project; myself and Mr. Shepard both being heralds, we'd work back together again if that project is revived.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
The project existed before and was fairly successful.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
This seems like a useful project, I would be in support of its revival.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I can imagine that it'll be successful with more members.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
is a wonderful vexillologist and I think we'd utilize his talents.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am also in support of its revival. I could help in heraldry and seals.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Indeed; I can personally confirm that Mr. Dagsa designs wonderful heralds and seals.
I think this project would be highly welcomed by my fellow delegates.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Do anyone have anything more to add?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me no.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from Waterside Park.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Wonderful; so we move on.
The next on agenda is the discussion on Creation of Greencities Guides
The floor is open, fellow delegates.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would be happy to help with it, should it be created.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I don’t have much of an opinion on this, in all honesty. It would be a useful tool if created, but I fear it may fall into inactivity. I will most likely abstain on the motion.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I must concur with the Atieran delegate.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur as well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I don’t have much of an opinion on this, in all honesty. It would be a useful tool if created, but I fear it may fall into inactivity. I will most likely abstain on the motion.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
True, but noting how many projects in this Alliance end up, I honestly don’t know if it would be completed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Well, can we effectively implemented that project in the member states depending on the current situation?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would like to apologise, but I probably won't be present for the rest of the session. Really sorry.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Duly noted, and its fine.
I would ask if anyone else have anything to add to this?
And also, feeling to ask, if I am just rushing with the agenda?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think not.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I have nothing to add, and I think you’re going at a perfectly fine speed.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me either.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you delegates; and we shall move on to one of the important agendas.
The next is discussion on the GUM-CA relations
to provide a brief out.
Like who are the individuals involved? how far have the discussions gone to.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
As of right now talks have slightly picked up - Jack Dean is going to add some GUM staff members to the Southampton Commission and the GUM were discussing it during their latest quorum. Although it isn't much of a change, it's a start.
I reckon that we might be able to kickstart talks sometime in the upcoming week.
I cede the floor.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you, Mr. Chair. What is the Southampton Commission?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would love to see talks between the two organizations take place, and a professional relationship between them flourish.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Thank you, Mr. Chair. What is the Southampton Commission?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd point that me, Mr. Lycon, and Mr. Hamilton are members of the staff of both organizations. I might be a good decision to include us three.
Any member have anything to add on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that they may be instating staff members including the VC.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
VC? Video or voice call?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Vice Chair.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
My bad, apologies.
Yes, she's an important part of the organization, she should be there.
Alright, shall we move on the next agenda?
The last discussion before moving on to membership discussions:
The floor is open for discussion.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would definitely be in favor of the act being repealed. It seems to have caused more issues than it set out to solve. Perhaps an alternative solution can be figured out in the future, but for now, repealing this act is the best way to ensure Parliament keeps moving.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur with the Honorable delegate from Atiera.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As for my lack of knowledge to this; I'd be abstaining on the matter.
Any further comments?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you; we should move on to membership discussions.
The first is on the Federated States of Gapla.
Gapla</div>
Home</div>
The remarks on Gapla.
I feel that they'd be accepted as a part of the organization.
However, inactivity is something that had strucked the nation
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Due to the issues noted yesterday involving their anti-LGBT past, and the fact that they seem to wish to ignore that ever happened, I will either be abstaining or opposing this nation’s entrance.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur. I will either abstain or oppose.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I was not aware of those things.
Any further comments?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, so we move on.
The next is on:
New Rubix Republic</div>
The New Rubix Republic, more commonly known as New Rubix, is a self-declared sovereign state more commonly referred to as a micronation by external observers. It is located in the South Eastern part of the Australian continent. The Republic has 9 citizens in a primarily local presence and is under a unitary military dictatorship with a President...</div>
The floor is open.
It calls itself a military dictatorship; I am not sure how democratic they are.
Myself hold the highest ranks in my nation, but still being addressed to as General in a general sense describes of the autocratic role.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They looks very presentable and professional to me.
Definitely a support.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
They seem professional enough based on the interactions I’ve had with them. They seem fairly developed as well. I will support this nation’s entry.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thanks for the comments; any further comments?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I shall be supporting New Rubix's entrance.
None from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you.
There is nothing more on the agenda. If any delegates wishes to add something, the floor is open; otherwise, we may close the session in the next 5 minutes.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The session stands adjourned until further notice.

Any questions before we begin?
I take that as a no, so let's begin.
First off we have the Cupertino Awards evening.
This is something that I've wanted to do since I entered office, so I hope to host this sometime next month.
The floor is open to discussion.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is intermittently present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that we should figure out a suitable date/time to host an awards evening, what awards in addition to the current awards we should hand out and who should host it.
CwabMan: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that this should be something for the Lt. Chair to host.
CwabMan: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Will we be printing certificates and mailing them like the GUM did?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Will we be printing certificates and mailing them like the GUM did?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd oppose to printing certificates and mailing them; this is just a waste of money.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
At personal expense, it would be something nice though
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with the Chair.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's a nice idea but it wouldn't be worth the money.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
However the treasury would not be interested in covering their expenses
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Where does the treasury get the money may I enquire?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It's just a fancy term for my bank account
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Some delegates might not wish to give their personal information as well.
CwabMan: 
Hysterical.

What are the categories that we've thoughts to confer the awards?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I've come up with a few ideas:

for those who excell in all areas.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A) Science &amp; Technology
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Could we also hand out some Cupertino Service Ribbons?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd be suggestive of adding the category on diplomacy as well.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I think this would be for the best to save us spending hours debating the topics here
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yeah, there is foreign affairs.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I'd be suggestive of adding the category on diplomacy as well.
<div class="quote">Could we also hand out some Cupertino Service Ribbons?
We should also define when to host this session.
I think that Friday and/or Saturday evening would probably be the best time in my opinion.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
What are the pre-existing awards?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I think we should do something along the lines of a GUM model and have some sort of democracy implemented into the system
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's actually what I was thinkng.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Lovely.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Ministers can elect nominations and then everyone can vote for the best.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yeah, I think we'd ask nations to nominate themselves for the category with a good reason and then members vote.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">What are the pre-existing awards?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd love to nominate Vishwamitra for the foreign affairs category.

Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I was not boasting of anything; you're an ally of Vishwamitra and well aware of how we maintain diplomacy.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm not saying boasting - I'm talking about relations beyond the treaty if you understand what I mean.
So nations that actively improve relations through projects and cooperations.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thats what we focus on. Relations beyond treaty.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Unless anybody wishes to add anything further, we shall move on.
Alright next up we have the Shared boat design initiative.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">A few days ago Jayden Lycon proposed this in <span class="mention">#announcements</span>:
Would you like to speak on behalf of this?

Vishwamitra is no longer present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Of course.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This proposed project can help micronational navies be more realistic in a way with doesn't include spending thousands on a boat. This project can also boost cooperation between other micronations, increase the identity of one's nation, and will spur innovation and development in participants.
The documents are planned to include a list of materials on how to build it, a basic orthographic projection, and instructions.
I yield
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
Anybody wish to add anything?
I'd be willing to pitch into this project with 1-2 Aenopian designs including aircraft if there's demand with this inititive.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Note that these documents will be exclusive to CA members at this time
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

I also see no issues with this plan considering that it's an opt-in initiative that doesn't really need a huge amount of moderation.

Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I do not.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall move on.
Next up we have the replacement of the Minister of Agreements and Developments.
Do you wish to speak on behalf of this, considering that you proposed this motion?
I'm going to presume not.
In short, the Minister of Agreements and Developments has been a bit inactive lately, with very little coming from him.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Of course.

Alright thank you.

What kind of agreements and developments does the minister take care of?

I will be sending them an alert regarding this later this week before we move to a VoNC sometime soon.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Most of its duties have been outsourced to their specialized ministries anyways

I do not believe so no
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Is there even a need for this Ministry anymore?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I suppose it would be the best option to terminate it
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that dissolving the ministry and outsourcing the work to other ministries would be the best option.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe they'd actually contribute to the organization with a more suitable person

The first on the agenda is the discussion on the Replacement of the Minister of Agreements &amp; Developments.
The floor is open for discussion.
Members are asked to maintain decorum.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
May I ask why they are being replaced?
Lack of activity?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I shall find what Mr. Lycon said last night on the matter.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I might be interested in applying, if that's how it's processed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I might ministers are picked rather than self-nomination.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would support the Minister’s replacement. If I recall correctly, he has not attended a single session since March. That specific position should be quite active in the Alliance, and replacing him with a new Minister would be quite beneficial.

True. Surely this job should be down to the entire legislature.

And how has it be beneficial?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The Ministry of Agreements and Development focuses on projects in general as far as I'm aware.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But I found that some projects were looked on by other ministries?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Seems quite vaguely defined. My personal opinion is that this ministry isn't particularly neccessary.

I concur with my Waterside Park counterpart.

The ministry may have been more active and useful in the past, however this is unfortunately not the case any more.

Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park has no naval forces, and as such, has no opinion on the subject.

I could abstain from this on behalf of Vishwamitra.

Whilst Novus Hierosolymis does have a military, it is purely honorary, so I may abstain.

In order to host the session, we need to decide on:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
My proposal is that we create a micronational Music chart which will be headed by the Cupertino Alliance. Essentially the system will work via the use of Last.fm, which is an incredibly handy software that tracks what music you listen to which it then categorises into handy information (you can see an example of this here: <a href="https://www.last.fm/user/Aenopia)">https://www.last.fm/user/Aenopia)</a>. The software is free to use, and tracks music played (called scrobbles) on any music streaming app as long as you have the associated software to scrobble it including Youtube, Spotify, Apple Music, Itunes, Souncloud, Deezer, you name it. 
Aenopia’s Library | Last.fm</div>
Listen to music from Aenopia’s library (8,178 tracks played). Get your own music profile at Last.fm, the world’s largest social music platform.</div>
I cede the floor.
I believe that we should either share the information via a special news site or create a video containing the 30-40 songs which have been listed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I see this initiative as a good one to promote each nation's culture.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
I would be willing to head the project starting from next week if people are in support of the idea.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would be happy to help with this project.
You can link last.fm with spotify and MusicBee

Sorry for my absence. I would be delighted to indulge in Hindi songs for the first time.

Should we open it to the wider community as well by having it as a Cupertino-led project or just make it a member state exclusive project.
<div class="quote">Sorry for my absence. I would be delighted to indulge in Hindi songs for the first time.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The Cupertino Alliance is an organization set up much into the Western culture, etc; would be good but definitely challenging for me, somewhere from the East to promote its culture, songs, which to most are completely new.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
So you are saying that non-English songs must be allowed on the list? I concur with that.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
My only concerns with this project is that some people may cheat using external software.

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Well, I thought that; the whole thing is confusing for me.
I wish to clear this out of the session.
I don't want this to halt the session.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park:

Aenopia is present.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania will be temporarily present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Welcome to this evening’s session. If you have not already, please take a look at our agenda for this 85th session which can be found here:
85th session agenda</div>
85th session Agenda 3rd Parliament, 85th session American Session 16 May 2021 at 9PM UTC / 5PM EST    The following document is the official agenda and the associated resources of the 85th  Parliament session. The 85th session is a American Session scheduled to be hosted on 16 May 2021 at 9PM...</div>
We will begining in about 5 minutes.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Alright, it seems we have enough to start so lets get right into it.
First on our agenda is the discussion of the replacement of the Minister of Agreements and Developments, Konstant&#237;nos Hockenheim. The activity of this Minister has been scarce over the last few months. Their last remark in a session was on 16 April 2021, regarding the Great Des Plaines Valley War, with that being their only remark for the remainder of the session. Hence the reason why many are calling for his replacement.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Are we replacing him or simply eliminating the position altogether?
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
We are seeking to replace him.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
If inactivity is the issue, I'd support a replacement.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Pinelandia is present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I concur as well.
Seems only logical.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
We did suggest dissolving the entire ministry during the last 2 sessions as well.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
If I'm being honest, I'm not sure that is the wisest of ideas, as this ministry could be pretty important if an active minister filled the position.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
And I concur with Mr. Alexander.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Thank you. Is there any further disscussion or comments?
As there appears not to be, we'll be moving on.
Moving on to the next item on the agenda is the discussion of the shared boat design initiative, mentioned by Jayden Lycon, delegate for Qaflana, where he mentioned sharing the blueprints of various micronational ships. 
to discuss the mater.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I support this initiative. It would be greatly beneficial to members who desire to form a navy.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
He appears not to be online so the floor is open to discussion.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I'm unfamilliar with these micronational ships, may I get informed on these ships and what materials they require?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I'm not sure about the specifics, but I think they're pretty basic materials like wood, cardboard, etc.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
And these ships do indeed work, correct?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Correct, some of them are Aenderian Coast Guard ships, of which there are photos on MicroWiki.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Alright, in that case I think its a great idea. Giving micronations the abillity to bolster their defensive is always a plus.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur. I also think this would be a fun project to pick up if you have some spare time.
I do enjoy building things myself.
Are there any further comments before we move on?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I have a quick gander, Sir?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
A quick gander of what, Mr. Valentinus?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The proposal at hand.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is sporadically present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Alas, I can say that I am neither interested nor will participate in said project. I personally don't see why handing out boat instructions would constitute an project, as opposed to a kind donation.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Duly noted.
Is there anything else to be said by the honourable delegates?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd call it less of a donation if anything.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Alexander, may I make comment on an earlier item before we move on?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Sure, go ahead.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Regarding the proposition to dissolve the Agreement and Development ministry outright:  I feel it is unfair to blame the ministry itself for the issues, when we have had a combination of an inactive cabinet member and the recent surge in outsourcing what used to be the ministries work to a plethora of standing committees, of which I feel have become oversaturated and will return the alliance to its earlier period of micromanagement.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I will have to leave for a short while, I will return in around 10 minutes.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I cede.
Deleted User: 
New Rubix is present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur with the honourable delegate
Is there anything else before we proceed?
Deleted User: 
How are the vessels powered?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I believe by some sort of sail or even current of a river.
Are there any further comments?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Seeing that there are none, we will move on.
to speak on it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
I will mostly be reiterating what was discussed during the last 2 meetings, but in short the plan is to host a Cupertino Awards ceremony in the next few weeks - what we need to establish now is when we should host it and whether we should open it to the wider community.
We have (mostly) established what awards will be handed out, and as far as I'm aware we've settled on a software to host it on.
I cede.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Thank you Mr. Ross. I open the floor to discussion.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Apologies for my tardiness, but Atiera is present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Is there any discussion?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would enjoy seeing such a ceremony take place.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
As would I. It’s important to recognize the contributions of our members
Before we move on, is there anything else to be said on this point.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Well the question isn't whether or not we should do it, it's when
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
And whether or not it'll be advertised to the public
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We need to establish a date for this event.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Perhaps June?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I was thinking the same.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Heck, why not the end of May?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Have we decided if it will be in text format, like the sessions, or in a video chat format?
Deleted User: 
Will the recipients receive a physical copy of the award?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The only day I will be unavailable would be June 9th. Other than that, I’m completely open until the last week of June.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
It was mentioned that a digital certificate would be sent for recipients to print out.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qalfana is intermittenly present
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Welcome.
Deleted User: 
Alright.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I believe it will be held over video chat.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Heck, why not the end of May?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Sounds good to me.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Then I recommend a zoom webinar. It will allow the host to be the only visible and audible individual, while anyone can attend and watch the awards.
The host can also grant video/audio privileges to others if needed
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Zoom and google meets were the two programs mentioned.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes but I'm advocating for a zoom webinar as opposed to a zoom meeting
If zoom is chosen, that is
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
What’s the difference between a webinar and a meeting?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I have returned.
What have I missed?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I am sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Deleted User: 
Why not host it on discord vc?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Discord Voice Chat has limitations for the number of people present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
We are discussing the Cupertino Awards. Scroll up for more info.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It's quite finicky to use
Deleted User: 
Fair enough.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that hosting it via a Stage Channel would be the better option actually.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unless people wish to use the screenshare/camera functions.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Ah, I see. That does sound quite useful.
I would be in favour of using Zoom Webinars
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
As would I.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Are there any further questions or comments?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I would be in favour of doing Webinars as well.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Shall we move on?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Sure
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
We still haven't decided on the original questions
When, and if it'll be public?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
as I am not that knowledgeable on this subject
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
In the upcoming weeks I think.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
But I would presume it’s going to be public.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">We still haven't decided on the original questions
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
If we decide later on to use discord, it won't be public
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I believe that they should be public to everyone.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">If we decide later on to use discord, it won't be public
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Will it be recorded?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I would support it being recorded and/or published to YouTube.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
But the last thing we need is potentially dozens of random individuals joining our server as observers for this event. We'd have to perm them all.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I concur
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
That would definitely pose an issue.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">But the last thing we need is potentially dozens of random individuals joining our server as observers for this event. We'd have to perm them all.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I propose that, if it's held on discord, for it be private, but otherwise it should be public.
Deleted User: 
Perhaps announce the event prior and allow interested parties to register to view the event?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe for the sake of accessibility we should have the event as a Zoom webinar
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur with the Lt. Chair.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Is there anything else to be added?
Alright, let’s move on.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia will be intermittently departing the session.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
to speak about it.
Oh, my apologies, he will be leaving for now but I will pull up the remarks Mr. Ross had on this matter the other day
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I can quickly brief everyone regarding this.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Yes please, you have the floor.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
for further information surrounding how to create and pair a last.fm account to your music streaming software of choice.
I cede.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
<a href="https://discord.com/channels/554799257643647005/668550194257985561/843149306546356264" onclick="scrollToMessage(event, '843149306546356264')">https://discord.com/channels/554799257643647005/668550194257985561/843149306546356264</a>
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I ask, can the alliance justify this project? What does this bring to the alliance and its members.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with Delegate Valentinus.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I suppose it’s just for fun. Music is a pretty big part of our culture these days and it could simply be to share with everyone the music preferences and tastes of our diverse membership base.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
So what I understand is, the participants all play a set of music they normally listen too, and it gets compiled in a sort of top 30?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Correct. You connect the service to a music streaming platform of your liking and it takes notes of the top songs you listen to.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If it is merely a fun side-project that bears little consequence to the alliance as a whole, does it necessarily need to be present in session hearings?
It certainly wasn't important enough to have been voted on.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with Delegate Valentinus again.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
You have a good point, I’m not quite sure this is necessary to be discussed in a session.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I must concur. Definitely a fun idea, but not necessary for a session.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur. Are there any other questions or comments?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I concur, but I cannot participate as most of my music is listened to via mp3s.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Noted.
Alright, Is there any further business before we move onto membership applications?
Seeing none we will move onto the membership applications
First up we have the Kingdom of Wallenia:

Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Dutch micronationw
With a very professional looking wiki page.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur but I honestly don’t know enough to have say, thus I will be abstaining.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
They claim to have existed since 2014 in their earliest incarnation. They have a decently sized population. I can’t tell much more than that. I will be abstaining for the time being.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I think they should get accepted personally. They have a reasonable size, sizeable list of foreign relations, and a very profesional looking wiki page.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Duly noted.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I will have to leave.
Deleted User: 
I concur however I do not know much about them as of yet.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Are there any further comments?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Excellent. Let’s move onto the final application of the day.
Next, we have North Dirigo
North Dirigo</div>
North Dirigo, is a self-proclaimed Semi-federal republic and sovereign state, though it is commonly referred to as a micronation by external sources. Most of its territory is located in the U.S. states of Maine and North Carolina. Its capital city is Newton.</div>
Their wiki page is severely underdeveloped so I don’t have much to base my judgment off of
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I am opposed to the entry of this member nation, their leader would not be a good fit and the nation is underdeveloped
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
In my opinion, this nation is not developed enough to join the Cupertino Alliance. I will be voting no on this nation.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I concur. I will also be voting against.
Before I adjourn this session, are there any last remarks or last minute proposals?
or <span class="mention">#formal-members-pub</span> on how I did, as this is my first session. Have a good day.
The floor is now closed.

We have a very short session again this week, so unless anybody wishes to propose anything then we shall begin.
First we have the Observer Delegate Amendment which I forgot to add to the agenda so I apologise.
Do you wish to speak on behalf of this Amendment?

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Sure.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is partially present
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I noticed that the charter does not specify how many delegates Observers are entitled to. It has always been de-facto 3 so I thought this amendment will just formalize it and remove gray space.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I have issue with section 4.
It does not specify whether it is 51% of present members or 51% of all members.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think it has to be 51% present.
It should also be at least as well to clarify things further.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Otherwise it would be very difficult to void.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Amended, anything else?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Yes.
The name of the bill does not fit the established nomenclature as established by an earlier act of statute.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't see that as a critical issue in the long term however that should be fixed.
Anybody wish to add anything else before we move on?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nothing here.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then moving on.
Next up we have the suspension of Ludwig Brienović under the Individuals Veto Act.
As you may already know, Ludwig is currently representing applicant state Nichensburg, however we are all fully aware of his previous and current conduct.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Amended again.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I am not.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This document has 109 pages of evidence of his conduct and I have screenshots lined up. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yaDVtiuTyY80H-0dTp9oAocWBgCPVgj-86GuHMQsz7g/edit#heading=h.oa74ohugiw2i">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1yaDVtiuTyY80H-0dTp9oAocWBgCPVgj-86GuHMQsz7g/edit#heading=h.oa74ohugiw2i</a>

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I can attest to the more recent behaviour of this applicant in the server of the Kingdom of Begonia. Quite frankly, it is disgusting.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Discord light mode?
This discusses a CA delegate in an unacceptable manner which makes it even worse.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This behaviour is not tolerated here, and I do not wish to expose our delegates to harassment from this user.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
He has always behaved like this.
If this was so major an issue I do not see why he ought to have been let in.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Half of this isn't relevant.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I refuse to allow this sort of behaviour within the Cupertino Alliance.
<div class="quote">Half of this isn't relevant.
<div class="quote">If this was so major an issue I do not see why he ought to have been let in.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I do not see why a 109 page document had to be made.
This all seems a little childish and much.
Don't get me wrong, I disagree with everything he says, sexist, homophobic and nearly everything else.
But to produce a portfolio?
LamentTwice: 
Nova Tromso is present.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This seems like very childish behaviour and it is uncharacteristic of the CA.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I must concur with My Honourable fellow Monmarkian Delegate here, I do disagree with a lot of what Brienović says, but much of this is unnecessary.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">But to produce a portfolio?
<div class="quote">This seems like very childish behaviour and it is uncharacteristic of the CA.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Having no clue who that is, it still seems a tad much.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I must depart from the session, as my tea has arrived from the takeaway.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It still conveys the point that the behaviour is unacceptable.

Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Alright then we shall move on.
Next up we have the Cupertino Music Charts results.
The test run for this week was concluded at about 15:00 UTC today and the results have been compiled.
However they will be shared during the next session tomorrow as they need to be added to the wesbite.
I am currently considering handing this over to Lawrence Martin based on his experience with last.fm and interest in assisting with the project, and I hope to open this to the wider community next week once the project becomes official.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I know nothing of music.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then moving on.
Next up we have the fate of the Ministry of Agreements and Developments.
Last session we were discussing the future of the ministry, so I feel like we should decide on whether to dissolve it or not before putting it to a vote.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I think a reorganisation, bureaucracy purge or just a simple review of purpose for many of these Ministries would be very helpful.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It would only be used in rare situations, but definitely serves a purpose.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I think it could be useful for promoting international treaties or making treaty formats.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I guess so.
But even then would creating treaty formats be a worthwhile usage of an entire ministry?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I don't think so
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Could we move on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I believe that we would be better to dissolve the ministry.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would think it should also be in charge of twins cities
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I believe that the Twin Cities project should be handled by the Ministry of Environment and Geography simply because of the Geographical feature.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Alright moving onto applications.
Kingdom of Nichensburg
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I don't see why we can't let them in.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette:

Warmedic - Monmark: 
THE WHAT
FOURTEEN?!
Well
On the basis that Pedophiles are
Safe to say
Bad
I vote no.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Not only that, but the blatant imbalance in female-male rights.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
But the pedophilia points are even more concerning.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville has returned.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I doubt any of them have eh
How you say
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The fact that the page is a week old says differently.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Engaged in unholy acts
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is present; apologies for my absence.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
And even if they have changed then it'll be too soon for me in my opinion.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from me.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I will have to go back to Nichenburg to see for myself, or consult leadership.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright we shall move on then.
Republic of Bushistan
Their website apparently has the appropriate links.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Chair, when available, I would like to make a statement on the proposals regarding the Ministry of Agreements and Development, and the Individual Veto motion.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That can happen following this application.
Their website looks very developed.

The Republic of Bushistan, or just Bushistan, is a micronation with scattered territories across Alabama and Mississippi. The mainland is located in Alabama, home to its capital, Bush City. The country has various attractions, including a museum, a memorial park, a space center with tours, a multipurpose sports complex, 2 national parks, and 3 n...</div>
Their MicroWiki page doesn't look too bad though.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They had a coup recently.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
My only concern is that there were apparently sovereignty issues during their last application which is of concern.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
MicroWiki isn't a heaven send resource.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe they have applied in the past.
Waterside Park is intermittently present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">MicroWiki isn't a heaven send resource.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
And I think that them joining the CA could help their governments legitimacy.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd be willing to give them a chance so long as we can confirm their stability.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Agreed.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Hear hear.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'll most likely be abstaining.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nothing from Monmark.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
before we conclude for this evening.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Regarding the proposed abolition of the ministry of agreements and developments, I believe that is ridiculous.
Secondly, I would like to motion that the proposition to suspend Ivan Brienovich  under the Individuals Veto Act be forwarded as an Urgent Motion.
I cede.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I don't think that making an urgent motion is necessary.
He is not a member, and additionally we have not let in Nichenburg in yet.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I agree with the Urgent Motion.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I wouldn't say it is urgent.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This just adds to the childish, aura.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
No, it merely cuts down on readings.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Ironic.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Quite frankly I cannot be bothered with 3 different arguments about the ban at 3 different times.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
A ban?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Well they are regional sessions so different people will talk about it.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
In one of the servers I operate in, when we find someone annoying and inflammatory we let them see every channel they already could, but just not say anything.
If speech is the issue, then no more speech.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything?
Alright then I would like to formally conclude this evening's session at 19:58.
Thank you for everyone for attending this evening's session and a reminder regarding tomorrow's session at 15:00 UTC.

Confirm your presence, we begin in 5 minutes.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qaflana intermittenly present
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is present.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Is anymore members attending?
We only have 4 nations attending; that's a very low attendance.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It is an Asian / Oceanian session so those get a diminished attendance
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, we begin now.
Also, my WI-FI connection is fluctuating so, there maybe some issues.
The first on the agenda is the Cupertino Music Charts results.
<a href="https://charts.cupertinoalliance.ca/">https://charts.cupertinoalliance.ca/</a>
We ought to begin the music thing from new week onwards.
The floor is open for discussion.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Pretty successful so I'm supportive of expanding it in the future
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think it has been quite successful at introducing many different types and genres of music to the Alliance.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I concur with the delegate from Novus Hierosolymis
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur with the Honorable Delegate.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
All members present today have been supportive of the initiative.
Anymore comments?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, we may move on.
The next on the agenda is the Discussion on downgrading Wegmat to observers.
They're being downgraded on grounds of inactivity
The floor is open.
They're present on 25/04/2021 for the last time; and before that on 26/02/2021
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I am against this proposal. If you are unaware, Cole (Wegmat's delegate) had quite a bit of missing assignments to finish, not to mention that hes still in school. Plus, with the Des Plaines war going on, there isn't much time for him to be active. I rest my case.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur with the Honorable delegate from Wendatia.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd like to point Mr. Rhymer that most delegates are in school or university but they attend. If they fail to, they can simply appoint some other individuals.
I'll be supportive of their downgrading.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I do not concur anymore with the delegate from Wendatia, and concur with the Hon. delegate from Vishwamitra.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
He only completed all of his missing assignments recently. Also i think opinions on micronational war are irrelevant when it comes to downgrading member states.
I can always ask him about appointing another delegate
I remain against this proposal.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Anymore comments?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
None from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We move on.
The next on the agenda is the discussion on Republic of Bushistan
<a href="https://discord.gg/Tby25r92v9">https://discord.gg/Tby25r92v9</a> 
Sander I - Revalia: 
(I concur)
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They're once a pretty active nation however haven't heard of them recently.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
They seem promising.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Sander I - Revalia: 
To be honest, Bushistan seems a bit strange to me, as I know its history.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yeah, I concur.
They did not have that great history.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
The fact that they have been able to gain that much praticipance and only have been founded 6 months ago, makes me pretty confident they are a good addition.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I do not concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Anymore comments?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
None from me
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Sander I - Revalia: 
None from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
There's nothing more on the agenda, unless any of the delegates proposes something.
Otherwise, we would adjourn the session in 5 minutes.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
May i ask
how do i appoint a secondary delegate?
Sander I - Revalia: 
I need to know it too.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As the principal delegate of your nation to the organization, you may do it on your will. There's no set rules for it.
Just invite the person appointed to the server and the staff members would grant roles, just inform us.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
ALright.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Okay, great.

Welcome to the 88th session of the Cupertino Alliance.
Due to the Chair being out right now, we will have to use the 87th agenda, just as another reading.

Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
So the chair did not publish a 88th session agenda?
Was anything supposed to be different on the 88th session agenda?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, I have not received one, and tried to ping him on it.
Not to my knowledge, no.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
SR can be here for a bit
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
forgetting to accommodate the American Affairs.
So let's begin.
So we have the Third reading of the Observer Delegate Amendment first.

Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia will be abstaining.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Do you wish to speak on behalf of this proposed amendment?
James B. - Desert District: 
Mr. Speaker, may I have the floor after Mr. Burdette?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Granted.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Well I think it formalizes something that's already de-facto. The charter never states how many delegates Observers are entitled to but it has always been 3 de-facto.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is moving from Abstain to Support
James B. - Desert District: 
May I?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
James B. - Desert District: 
I firstly would like to applaud the honorable delegate from Burdette for acknowledging the vagueness of the Charter when specifying how many delegates observer states are allowed to possess.
I agree that observer members should also be able to have up to three delegates as opposed to only being permitted to have one.
I hope other delegates are able to find parts of the Charter that need fixing, and that these issues can be resolved with amendments and hopefully in the near future, a new charter.
I cede.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
I am in support of this notion.
Any other comments before we move on?
James B. - Desert District: 
None from I.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Moving on.
Next is the discussion of Downgrading Wegmat to observers.
I currently fully support this.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Why would we downgrade them?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don't think that the inactivity is fault of the delegate, I think it is a fault of the nation.
Inactivity.
James B. - Desert District: 
Wegmat is actively participating in a war, I don’t think that’s inactivity.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They attended a session last month.
James B. - Desert District: 
I’m afraid I’ll have to at this point oppose the downgrading.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They only stated that they are present, without adding to the session.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If they go another month without attending a session then I would support downgrading.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I am fully against this proposal. The reason wegmat has been inactive as of lately is due to their current delegate having just completed a bunch of missing assignments. Not to mention they are in the middle of a war.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
James B. - Desert District: 
That’s also just in the session.
They regularly participate in other functions of the Alliance.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That's why we give them a little time.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
i encourage all delegates here to vote against this downgrading proposal.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's not like I wan't to downgrade them, but when it comes down to it if they can't show up to a meeting anytime soon, I wouldn't be so opposed.
Any other comments before moving on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
For while I will not be present at today's session, I deeply apologise for the lack of a formal agenda.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's alright, Mr. Chair.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
I support the downgrade of Wegmat. They have had ample opportunity to employ another delegate. The rules apply to everyone.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I am against Bushistani membership. 
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is Present.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur with the Honorable delegate from West Sayville.
James B. - Desert District: 
Their MW has good info, there’s nothing that seems necessarily bad, and since it’s just observership I’ll support.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Outside of stability, I wouldn't be opposed to them.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
May I ask the Member for west Sayville why they oppose their membership?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They recently had a coup it looks like.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Ah thank you for the clarification.
Lurdentania opposes their membership at this point in time.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I know a website shouldn't be your game changer when it comes to members, but it seems professional to me. But checking their history they had tons of things happen in the last 6 months.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I mean... I did literally say the reason in my statement, but alas.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, maybe in a couple of months.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Maybe after spelling is corrected... but not right now
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They didn't capitalize much at all, definitely not professional.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Exactly
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Perhaps this is not their first language?
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Perhaps
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Can we confirm it isn’t though?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There are several reasons why that could be the case.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania will no longer be present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I agree. You can't go based off of that.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
How exactly would we do that? Ask them?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They are located in the US which would lead me to believe it is.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
That I am unsure of
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
It is still unprofessional.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This is why such things like that should not be a deciding factor, rather a footnote.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Shouldn't be the basis of it.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Hm
Rory - Lurdentania: 
English is their official language.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I can suddenly decide to make a micronation based in the Philippines if I really wanted to.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I apologize for not being present for the discussion about Wegmat, but could I please make a late statement on it?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Go ahead.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Thank you.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
With our language being Swahili.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Yes, there is no way to confirm otherwise.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
How about I go ask them?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Why not?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I am in favor of the proposal on Wegmat being demoted to an observer state for the time being. Wegmat rarely attends sessions and has had months to provide a new delegate. However, if they show improvement over the next few sessions as a member state, I would be in favor of reinstating their member status. I cede the floor.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Hear hear!
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
So Bushistan actually applied in January too.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

Anthony I - Saspearian: 
We had some Wi-Fi issues earlier.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If I recall, unless I am confusing it with February, were they in fact not an independent state?
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
Wegmat is now present.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
How long have they been a member?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Over a year.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
The Federal Union has been a member over a year.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Duly noted
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
We are currently looking for a new delegation.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They were a independent state until Febuary.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I am unable to put enough time to fully attend sessions.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
On 2 February 2021, the Republic of Bushistan was officially integrated into the Kingdom of Serremwen as a Colony/Satellite State to help stabilize the nation after an economic crash.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Interesting
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Truly sorry on that.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Just asked the president and his first language is English along with the Aidan Pierce.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright so it was grammar.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
I may recall that observer states are de jure permitted to have unlimited delegations?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
But yeah speaking on this I think that they are not fit for the CA.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Hmm
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I mean a little grammar can be fixed easily I'm just more concerned about the coup.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Same, but still as a footnote.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
I concur
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Either way i'm opposing this nation.
Any other comments before we close out?
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Observers cannot vote but I urge delegates to vote against
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright with that, I will be closing today's session.
This was a very productive session, even though it waas back to back with the 87th session.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
First off I would like to begin by alerting everyone to events which will occur in June.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unfortunately I have mock exams which will be occurring in mid-June. Because of this, I will be taking a leave of absence from 14 to 25 June.
This means that Matthew Xia will be taking over under his role as Lt. Chair.
I will try to remain active wherever possible, however I will not be present to lead sessions/coordinate projects/etc.
I will be discussing this with the Ministry team to ensure that this goes as smoothly as possible.
With that out of the way, I would like to move onto the next item.
Although this is not on the agenda, I would like to alert delegates that round 2 of the Twin Towns project will be closing in 3 days.
This means that you only have 3 days if you wish to apply to the project.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is intermittently present.
Good luck in advance with your mocks.

Unless anybody wishes to add anything further we shall move on.
Next up we have the final round of updates regarding the Cupertino Charts.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I have a question, Mr. Chair.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As you all may have seen, the project has been extremely successful. Because of this, I will be formally releasing the project to the wider community on Monday. This means that this week's results will instead be released on Sunday.
<div class="quote">I have a question, Mr. Chair.
Sander I - Revalia: 
What exactly is the Cupertino Charts project?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
<a href="https://charts.cupertinoalliance.ca/about">https://charts.cupertinoalliance.ca/about</a> explains it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
In short it's a music chart project run by the Cupertino Alliance.
As part of this development of the project, I will be handing over the administration of the project to someone else from next week onwards.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Okay.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Because of the fact that they're currently running the website, I wish to nominate Lawrence Martin for running the project.

Sander I - Revalia: 
Not from Revalia.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nothing here.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall move on.
Next up we have the Digital Summit.
Because of the recent drive to conduct events, I have decided that we shall be hosting the upcoming Digital Summit as the 100th session.
By my estimation that should be a Friday session in about 1 month.
We have also decided on hosting the summit via Zoom as well.
Sander I - Revalia: 
That is great news.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
What we need to decide now is what should be included in the summit.
Should it be open to the wider community? Should we have an informal time post-summit?
The floor is open to discussion.
I think that having an informal time after the session to play games like Kahoot, Gartic, Skribbl.io, etc. would be a fun experience for members.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I think we should definitely give each delegate time to state something, in a few minutes. It would of course be an option.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I believe that opening it to the wider community would allow them to see properly what the CA does and how it differs from the other major organisation the GUM.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Maybe having guest speakers from delegates and members of the community?
<div class="quote">I believe that opening it to the wider community would allow them to see properly what the CA does and how it differs from the other major organisation the GUM.
Essentially an Open Day if you will.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur with the ideas of opening it to the community and having guest speakers.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I would support having guest speakers, though I believe that they should come from within the CA, so that it stays a CA focused summit rather than just any old summit.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I have an inquiry regarding the summit if I may.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Is Zoom undisputedly settled upon?
Or like, can I come with alternatives porpositions?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I prefer Google meets, but I have no idea on how it works across platforms.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that it was the option that the most people agreed on.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
Zoom is the platform most would be familiar with I believe.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
- chances are if we leave them here then it'll turn the session into a dispute regarding which platform is best.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I figured since Zoom required instalment it is not as easily accessible for everyone?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't believe it requires too much set up as far as I'm aware.
If people need support then we can always provide guides as well.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
What will happen if we have severe technical difficulties?
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
There is no need to download as it can all be done using the website.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Really?
Would be optimal.
I think.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">What will happen if we have severe technical difficulties?
If push comes to shove then we can always have Discord as a fall back plan, even if it can't hold as many people as other software.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Alrighty then.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Some discord servers regularly use VCs to replay films and such and it's usually flawless.
Usually around 30-40 people at once
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I haven't had many issues with discord, but I'm not sure how many people are attending.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Good heavens, I didn't know that VC's supported that many people.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I think the problem is that you can only have 25 with video on discord.
Video as in face cam.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I doubt that too many people will be using video during the event anyways.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Face cam isn't necessary, and I doubt it could be made mandatory.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Burdette is present.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Greetings

It now supports 50 viewers up from 10.</div>
Warmedic - Monmark: 
The more you know.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
In fact I don't even think that we need to use Zoom if Discord can handle the number of people in VC.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Zoom just seems like an extra, unnecessary step.

<div class="quote">Zoom just seems like an extra, unnecessary step.
Apparently you can fit as many people in VC as your computer can handle.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Discord seems fully capable of doing the job, and everyone already has it, so it should work like a charm, hopefully.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If I was to guess how many people will be in the VC, I'd say about 30ish so we should be fine.
<div class="quote">Discord seems fully capable of doing the job, and everyone already has it, so it should work like a charm, hopefully.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I mean everyone can use Zoom it takes minutes to download.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I will be testing this out sometime this week, so unless anybody has any objections then Discord will be our primary platform for the Digital Summit and any other digital events.
<div class="quote">I mean everyone can use Zoom it takes minutes to download.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
We all have discord as it is, so we might as well use it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
How would moderation be handled on Zoom?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Shouldn't we vote on this?
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
Zoom has full moderation features including muting of participants, restrictions on chat etc
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
By the person who makes the zoom call.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Shouldn't we vote on this?
Alright then moving on.
Next up we have the nomination of Nicholas Lokin and Jonas Rhymer as Applicant Patrollers.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
May I inquire as to what Applicant Patroller means?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that we covered the idea of Applicant Patrollers during a session a few months ago, so for those that are not aware Applicant Patrollers will be delegates who are assigned towards checking the Discord servers of applicants to ensure that they are safe and appropriate for delegates.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Aha
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We had an issue with an applicant recently which had NSFW content on their server, so this will be very useful to ensure that people remain safe.
The floor is open to discussion.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I would object to any member being named a patroller if they are under the age of 18.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Hear hear.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I support the nomination.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I do not concur.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What does that even mean?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
My nation's discord server is seldom used for communication, and I concur with the honourable delegate from Australis.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I would object to any member being named a patroller if they are under the age of 18.
I didn't even think of that myself.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Is the word patroller age restricted or something??
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It could be exposing children to unsafe content.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Let's see our own Chair! He is not 18 at all, but Carries his duties well.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Yeah I would be voting against both the nomination on the grounds that they are under 18.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
There is something here I'm not getting.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
No, however the role would involve checking servers for inappropriate content, which is not something this organisation should be getting under 18's to do.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The whole idea is to protect the CA from unsafe content. By appointing children to do this, we could be exposing them to this content.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Let's see our own Chair! He is not 18 at all, but Carries his duties well.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
NSFW, should be handled by someone of age.
Yes, well put.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unless anybody has any over-18 nominations I will be leaving this until a later point.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Checking Discord servers is that considered a task of the alliance?
Sander I - Revalia: 
Same here.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
It helps with the nomination process.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Mr. Mullins of New Athens, maybe?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Like with uh what's its name
Brienia?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Checking Discord servers is that considered a task of the alliance?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nichenburg**
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Mr. Mullins of New Athens, maybe?
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
This is a task that I believe they should nominate themselves for.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
They are just Discord servers.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Preferably we should be looking for delegates who don't currently have a role.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
Some persons may not wish to undertake such a task.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I'm certain they agree to being nominated?
Sander I - Revalia: 
I don't think CA has anything to do with other Discord Servers
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Should I instead put this as a job invitation in <span class="mention">#job-bureau</span>?
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I disagree.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I think reviewing Discord servers to gather information around the eligibility of a state to conduct its own affairs as a state is a very silly thing to do.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I would object if the CA was to call for a removal of a Channel, such as a NSFW channel, but I think knowing what happens within a state that want to join the CA is something that is very reasonable.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I present oncemore Nichenburg.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's the idea - we have no jurisdictions over what an applicant can have, however we can decide whether we can admit them or not based on their server content.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Very well said.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
We don't want to admit a nation which is doing something illegal or encouraging something illegal or dangerous.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
If a server is shown to be a place in which minors are regularly exposed to NSFW content then that may very well be a nation the CA does not wish to associate with.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Hear hear.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Say, for the sake of the argument, that a Discord server related to a well organised nation contained pornographic content. In what way does that affect their abilities and their legitimacy?
Sander I - Revalia: 
Hear hear.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Not at all, but you miss the point sir.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
And in what way does it affect the alliance or its member states?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">If a server is shown to be a place in which minors are regularly exposed to NSFW content then that may very well be a nation the CA does not wish to associate with.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
What if it was child porn?
What then sir.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Hear hear.
Sander I - Revalia: 
We are not going specific here
This is absurd
What if you don't exist?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I say, while child porn is surely a problem, it is not our problem. We are not Discord police, we are an organisation of states.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that we should move on from this topic.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
If something is going on that would damage the reputation of the CA, and our member states as a result of that, we should know about it before allowing them to join.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
So it is admitting a nation promoting illegal content.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Hear hear.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Bold of you to assume I exist.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I am saying that we can't talk about the what if... stuff here.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I don't see this discussion moving anywhere, and it doesn't seem particularly productive.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'll give everyone a moment to finish up before we move on.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
Australis is no longer present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I presume that everyone is finished.
Next up we have the rationalisation of standing committees.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Taking child porn randomly into this meeting was a mistake.
Sorry, we already moved on.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Over the past few months we have started to unintentionally move towards standing committees.
Although they aren't a bad thing, I feel like some committees may be better off under the management of their respective ministries.
The floor is open to discussion.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
We probably have too many
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
and <span class="mention">#bcoa-standing-committee</span> can be transferred over the the responsibility of the Minister of Public Affairs.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Agreed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">We probably have too many
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I have said before that I agree with reducing bureaucracy and I will be happy to vote on a plan to restructure them.
Or perhaps better put reorganise.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Anybody wish to add anything further then?
Alright we shall move onto our sole applicant for this evening.
Zircinia
The floor is open to discussion.
I'm trying to look for a wiki page now.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Are we moving away from Membership remarks?

<div class="quote">Are we moving away from Membership remarks?
Sander I - Revalia: 
The invite already expired.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This is partially my fault as I forgot to contact Leon this week.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
There is very very little information on this nation. I cannot make a educated vote.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
On the topic of the applicant, their page is very stubby and I believe that they were formerly expelled from the CA for inactivity.
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Cupertino_Alliance#Former_Members">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Cupertino_Alliance#Former_Members</a>
Cupertino Alliance</div>
The Cupertino Alliance (  (listen) (help&#183;info)) (also known as the CUP or CA,  also formerly known as the Cupertino Unified Micronational) is an intermicronational organization founded on 10 March 2019. Headquartered at Point Cupertino, Aenderia, it was created out of Aenderia's distaste for the Grand Unified Micronational and their accusations ...</div>
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I see no reason to vote against them or for them, so I believe I will abstain.
Sander I - Revalia: 
It is interesting that the current King is a Prince and the legislation is the same person.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It's a no from me.
Sander I - Revalia: 
It is a no from me too.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Concurrence.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
My the looks of it, a no from me as well.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I feel like I'm on American Idol.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then, anybody wish to add anything further regarding this applicant?
Sander I - Revalia: 
^
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Their flag looks like an interesting mix of Israel and North Korea.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nothing here.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Though that's not important.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
That's, oddly true.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Normally, I would say lol but this is a formal channel.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
...
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I have arrived everyone
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Congratulations.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then I'll give everyone 5 minutes before we formally conclude the session.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Sorry for being late.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If you wish to propose anything then here is your chance.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Nothing from Revalia.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Nothing from the SR honestly.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Nothing from Monmark.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Nice flag design though.
Have to admit that.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
That is true.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If nobody wishes to add anything then I will be adjourning this session at 20:05 UTC.
Thank you very much to everyone who has turned up for this session.

The 89th session is a European &amp; African Session scheduled to be hosted on 29 May 2...</div>
So now let's begin.
I will have to skip Twin Towns announcement, since I was not informed on it, so lets start on Digital Summit planning.
Currently, the Digital Summit is going to take place on the 100th session.
And during the 100th session, we will be in a VC.
Now it's undecided whether to host it over Zoom or Discord.
Personally I think Discord, but leave suggestions.
Deleted User: 
I also believe we should host the summit on Discord.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We can have like a specific event VC.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Personally, if I may, I see Google meet as most optimal. It is easy, it does not require much setup, and is quite managable.
Deleted User: 
Exactly what I thought.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Well, there are definitely pros and cons to both. We all already use Discord for sure, but most of us are familiar with Zoom as well. I don’t know enough about the stage feature to comment on that exactly.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
You can't share your screen on the stage feature.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Google Meets would also work well for this type of event, in my experience.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Right, exactly.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If I remember correctly.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Zoom is built around events like this.
Deleted User: 
Ahhh, that's got me thinking Zoom
Yeah, I now think maybe Zoom would be the best?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
But then again I saw people screen sharing movies with 20-30 users watching.
So it is a mixed bag.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
We could not hold an opinion poll?
Deleted User: 
Good idea.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That's probably for the best.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I personally am leaning towards a dedicated video chat platform such as Zoom, or Google Meets as the honorable delegate from Vishwamitra suggested.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
That would be a good idea.
Deleted User: 
Also, this is my first meeting as a delegate.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Congrats.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I personally do not believe we should host over Google Meets, not a lot of us personally are familiar about it.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
It’s a fairly intuitive platform, but that’s probably a discussion for a different time.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe it is very easy grow used to, as opposed to Zoom which requires installation and such as far as I'm aware.
Deleted User: 
Great point. I was going to state that I've used Google Meet maybe once or twice, but Zoom I've used, to exaggerate, a million times.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We could also use going back to it, Discord which requires no install since all of us use it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Same.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
How does one install and set up Zoom, and how would we use it?
Deleted User: 
Setup for Zoom takes like twenty seconds
It's very easy to install
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's mainly a quick setup.
Like download file, open it, press download and you are in.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
For Google meet, you would have to go to meet.google.com, use the code provided by the arranger, and you're in.
Deleted User: 
Most events of this fashion are hosted over Zoom.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
And then again we all have Discord.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Of course it's not that important, but just to provide with a kind of overview on the differences of Zoom and meet. For myself, I would rather avoid having to install zoom and uninstall zoom if it meant other people were going to have to use a code on a website.
Juan Cisneros - Aswington: 
As a result of a series of problems presented today, I have decided to resign as Aswington's Representative to the Cupertino Alliance.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Okay.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
And like the delegate for Atiera mentioned, it would be preferable to use a dedicated platform.
As opposed to, regular Discord.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<a href="https://www.howtogeek.com/674928/google-meet-vs.-zoom-which-one-is-right-for-you/">https://www.howtogeek.com/674928/google-meet-vs.-zoom-which-one-is-right-for-you/</a>
Google Meet and Zoom might seem almost the same. While both services make large-scale video conferencing easy, though, there’s a lot more going on under the hood. Here’s what you need to know to choose the right one for you.</div>
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The bold text really sums it up. Google Meet Is Best for Small, Quick Meetings; Zoom Is Best for Large Scale Meetings; If You Want Features, You Want Zoom; If You Want Simplicity, Pick Google Meet
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
This is beginning to drag on into a circle. As was suggested earlier, an opinion poll for the entire Parliament would probably be the best way to decide.
Deleted User: 
After reading, my opinion is still Zoom.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Anyways, we can take a poll on it.
Deleted User: 
Yes, let's.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Would be best.
Deleted User: 
Can we move on? Or not?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes we are moving on, hold on.
Next we have the Rationalisation of standing committees.
What this means is that the standing commissions will be rationalized to the Ministry of Public Affairs.
I personally am in support of this, however it would be a heavy workload for the minister.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Correct me if I’m wrong, but surely not every standing committee would be put back into the Ministry of Public Affairs?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Deleted User: 
Remind me who the minister is?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Let me check.
Anthony is.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is Present
Deleted User: 
Uhh just a little late...
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's not too late.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
May I ask why every standing committee would be delegated to the Public Affairs ministry? For example, the website standing committee would, in my opinion, be much better delegated to the Ministry of Technology.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
Deleted User: 
I also concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It is what the Chair stated.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
That seems sensible.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I wholly concur.
Deleted User: 
We should consider each and every committee and place them where they are of reasonable need, not just stick them all into one.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I believe committees should be rationalised depending on the type of committee to a ministry which covers the same subject, making the committee work more professional and effective as a whole, as we as lifting the workload off the Minister for Public Affairs.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Deleted User: 
That's basically what I just said, but I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Any other statements before we move on to membership time?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Without having any educated opinion, what the delegate from Burdette stated seems reasonable.
Deleted User: 
I think we are good to move on.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes.

This is hard pass.
This is such a hard no from me.
Deleted User: 
Also a hard pass for me.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Definitely a pass from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We have no remarks.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Right, we discussed this one yesterday as well I believe; I stick to my answer which is no.
Also why are there no remarks?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Interesting that they are already claiming to me a member of the Cupertino Alliance, at least that’s what their wiki page states.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Chair didn't contact Leon.
Usually Leon makes the remarks.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
No remarks, poorly constructed Microwiki, and only comment is they use the polish dollar? It will be a no from me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
There's no remarks as there's no information.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I doubt he could make remarks.
Deleted User: 
I think the vote's unanimous here?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Leon has always made the remarks I think.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
3 sentences.
Deleted User: 
<strong>NO.</strong>
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I mean as from 3 sentences.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
But why do we consider the applicant without the remarks?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Pass from Waterside Park.
Deleted User: 
Pass from the Kingdom of Burdette, sorry.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Because there is no Information for the minister to make his remarks on.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Simply because remarks aren’t required, I don’t believe. They’re just a helpful tool for Parliament to take a quick glance.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Are remarks based on the page?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
However, a glance can’t get much quicker than a 3 sentence wiki page.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We could seek a executive deny from the chair.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra:

Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

Tesforia is partially present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I suppose we should commence, let's hope that more members join as we go along.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
Wegmat is present.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qaflana int. present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The first item on the agenda is an announcement for the Twin Towns project.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright. We should now move onto the next item of the agenda, which is planning for a digital summit in the CA. This would ideally take place on the 100th session, which is in 10 sessions time, so in a couple of weeks.
Does anybody have any ideas on what we could to for this session? It would obviously be longer than a traditional session.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
We could hold a zoom meeting or a google meet of some sort.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
That was the plan, no?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
There were also plans for awards to be presented, but we're not sure what categories should be awarded yet.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I know this has been brought up in the summit planning channel before.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm also thinking guest speakers perhaps? Maybe get a speaker in from the GUM?
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I also think that the 100th session should be a zoom meeting of some kind.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would propose a section where delegates could share important updates from their nation. Atiera personally has quite a few updates and things planned that I would be delighted to share with Parliament.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with the honourable delegate from Wegmat.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Some delegates preferred the use of Google Meets due to the time limit on free zoom accounts.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Good idea.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah, a section where people can introduce their nation, go a bit more in depth into aspects of their nation?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would like to note that we should not worry about the time limit on free Zoom accounts. The Ministry of Technology has been working on that, actually.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
We could allow delegates and other Micronational figures to sign up and speak at this summit.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Exactly.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Zoom isn't free either?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
From what I know we have access to an account with unlimited time.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
That would be convenient.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
As of now, yes. However, we are working on a few things that aren’t exactly finalized, but we should definitely have an account of our own with unlimited time before the session.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Awesome.
Are there any further questions or comments on this matter?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
None from me.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, let's move on.
The CAoNI project has fallen into inactivity, and the administration would like to revive it again.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Sorry, what is the CAoNI project?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Does anybody have any suggestions on how we could restore activity to it again?
Deleted User: 
Burdette is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The Cupertino Areas of Natural Interest program.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Has the Environment Ministry been contacted regarding this matter?

Not that I'm aware of.
Who holds that ministry, by the way?

David Augustus does

Ah, alright.
Does anyone have any suggestions for it, then?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me. I’m not familiar enough with the project to have much to say about it.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
No, I haven't represented for a while in the parliament, so I'm not familiar with all that is going on at the moment.
Deleted User: 
No. I am not familiar with the project either.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is present.
Deleted User: 
Hello, Jayden.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I think the Ministry should have been contacted about this first prior to directing it to a session article.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
I think we should move on then, as delegates are largely unaware of the program.
Deleted User: 
Yes, we should, Mr. Hamilton.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe that truly shows the state it is in currently.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Deleted User: 
I also concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Reform needs to be made by the minister, to be presented to Parliament.
Next up we have the Rationalization of Standing Committees. As it stands, the Standing Committees are largely unorganised, inactive, and clog up space.
had some comments on the matter earlier?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
Deleted User: 
I stated my opinion on this yesterday, but I will restate it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You may.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
<div class="quote">Additionally, transferring every single standing committee under this ministry is not only a poor idea, but downright unfair.
Deleted User: 
We should consider each and every committee and place them where they are of reasonable need, not just stick them all into one.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I definitely support the matter. Relegating the committees back into their respective ministries would make many Minister’s jobs much easier. I would however like to note my message from yesterday. 
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Maybe not all committees need to exist?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The comments from Mr. Valentinus and Mr. Gladden are both very valid points.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Indeed.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Seems cluttered.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur. Personally, the website standing committee really complicated my job at first, and to an extent, it still does.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Keep Factbook/Census and the Charter standing committee but download all of the others to the respective ministries
Deleted User: 
I do believe the guides standing committee is necessary, though. It's a very helpful tool
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Possibly we could dismantle the committees that are most inactive and most useless, revive those who are worth it, and redirect some tasks to already established institutions.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
The former is such a large project that it would be complicated to do under one ministry
Deleted User: 
I also concur
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Look, Guides are predominantly made by <span class="mention" title="EndQuote#2696">@Jayden Lycon - Qaflana</span>, I don't see the use in a standing committee for that.

Let's move onto the final item on the agenda, a single membership application. After that, I'll be presenting something not on the agenda.
Deleted User: 
Alright, please proceed, Mr. Hamilton.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This is the third reading of Zircinia, a nation applying for membership.
Zircinia
Deleted User: 
<strong>Hard no.</strong>
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This is all that is presented by them. Disappointing, honestly.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I shall be opposed to the application.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It is to note that Zircinia did apply back a year ago but was expelled due to their lack of activity
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's not a great sign.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Definitely a no from me. Parliament seems to be unanimous on that as well.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
No information other than currency.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Deleted User: 
We did this yesterday and had a unanimous no.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Each nation has 3 readings.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think Mr. Gladden meant in the messages about the past readings of this application, not the voting, that they had a unanimous no.
Deleted User: 
Thank you for correcting my statements, Mr. Dagsa.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Considering we have a unanimous no, I would like to present something to the Parliament.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I have returned, Zircina is still a no from me.
Deleted User: 
Whatever Mr. Hamilton is preparing, it must be good.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
At the moment, the electoral system in the Cupertino Alliance is a mess. There are no confirmed election times, and no information for when campaigning should officially commence. I would like to see reforms to the electoral system ahead of the 3rd Cupertino Alliance chairmanship election, and as a candidate, I would like to request that instead, a non-biased delegate work to reform the rules. Perhaps the chairman could do this?
Deleted User: 
Shall we ping Logan?
Or no?
Was that a bad idea?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
He's not online right now.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> what are your thoughts on this matter?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Who other delegate would you recommend handing the mantle
Perhaps a panel of delegates would be better?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Smart idea.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
You’re definitely correct, Mr. Hamilton. The system is a mess, and the complete lack of organization is not something I would expect from an organization of such high esteem as the Cupertino Alliance. I have a major conflict of interest as well, so I wouldn’t be working at all near this, but I would definitely love to see some major reform take place before the election.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is present for a short period
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I will be abstaining from discussion on the matter at the moment, as a candidate.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Well I don't follow up much with the internal gears of the political system of the alliance, but if this is the situation I can't say much more than that it should be dealt with.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If there is no more discussion on this, I see fit to adjourn the session in 10 minutes. Any more proposals may be brought to the floor in this period.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
May I have the floor please
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You may.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Thank you
I have two things I want to bring up- the first one being the creation of a book documenting the flags of member / observer states and any design measurements, etc.
Ideally it would be created during the off season of the Factbook
Deleted User: 
I like this idea.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Perhaps naming it the Cupertino Alliance Vexillologist Standard
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
A book, I don't know, but some sort of documentation for sure.
Not a bad idea.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I mean it would be a collection of documentation per each nation but it would span into the length of a book anyways
Deleted User: 
Fully concur.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Though somebody would have to go through the bother of finding and asking for the right measurements and the right placement of this and that.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
This is fitting as I am preparing to standardize Novus Hierosolymis' national flag, and define its measurements, so on and so forth.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Fantastic
Should I proceed on my other item I would be discussing about?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Proceed.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Please.
Deleted User: 
Yes.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Now the domain project is currently underway testing but I have heard from a request from a campaign that they are interested in hosting their campaign website on the cupertinoalliance.ca domain- would it be in the best interests of the alliance to allow this request?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I think campaigns should be allowed a subdomain.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This matter was discussed by the Chair and Minister responsible but I just want to hear the opinions of Parliament
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think it should be allowed.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will abstain personally and just follow the advice of Parliament on this.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Obviously campaigns should be allowed to have their own domains if they choose, but a subdomain of the CA website should also be an option.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I think it would have to be equally available for all campaigns in that case.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It would have to be displayed VERY prominently that said campaign is not endorsed by the CA government
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes
Though hosting on the subdomain itself could cause some confusion
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Will that be all on the matter, then?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This session shall be adjourned in 10 minutes, at 11pm AWST, then, unless delegates have more to say on the matter.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
One quick reminder that the Capstone Tribune is looking for articles- please DM me if interested
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville:

As we have a fair amount to get done tonight I wish to begin soon.
Anybody wish to add anything before we begin?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I presume that nobody wishes to add anything, so let's begin.
First let's begin by discussing the August 2021 election timeline.
Delegates brought this up during the last session, so as we get closer to the conclusion of my term I feel like I should cover this now.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I wish to add real quick that the heading on the document has not been updated since parliamentary session 74.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm aware of that.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Could I add something?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
My current plan is to open nominations from 15 June until 15 July; during this period there will be NO campaigning and the period will only serve for running delegates to announce their campaign/running mate.
<div class="quote">Could I add something?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I would like to propose the revival of the quality images program.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qalfana int. present
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
It was tested a little bit a very long time ago, and I feel that it could be benificial.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'll add it to the agenda for discussion later in this session.
Onwards with the election timetable, my current plan is to run a campaign period from 16 July to 12 August.
After that will be the elections themselves.
Anybody wish to add anything regarding this plan?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Seems like a good plan to me. Hopefully this would relieve lots of stress from the candidates, unlike last election.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Deleted User:

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Right.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is intermittently present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I wish to strike a fine balance between productivity with the current administration and running mates, whilst also ensuring that the period is stress-free.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Are there any candidates by now? Or does registration commence later?
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I can speak from experience by saying that by the conclusion of the last election, I felt very stressed so I don't want that again.
<div class="quote">Are there any candidates by now? Or does registration commence later?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The only two announced candidates as of now are Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Burdette, but that is still unofficial I believe.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that Brennan Sullivan and Daniel Hamilton have confirmed their candidacy though.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Yes.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I have as well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Thanks.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Other than that, we shall move on.
Next up we will discuss improving American and Asian session times.
Some delegates have pointed out that the current session times aren't optimal for them, so I feel like another shake-up of the session times is in due order.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I have a question on that.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This will likely result in another Session optimisation survey.
<div class="quote">I have a question on that.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Sorry, it appears that my question is stupid. Continue.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
I wish to gauge people's current opinions on the session times and state any quarrels that they currently have with them.
The floor is open.
If there is a need for another optimisation survey, then I will begin working on it next week.
Deleted User: 
What are the times again?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Seems fine by me.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The only session time that doesn't work well for me is the Oceanic session time, but considering I live in the United States, and I can make the other two sessions, it's hardly an issue.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Maybe ask those who are subject to the issue.
Deleted User: 
I concur. I have to wake up at about 8:30 in the morning to get to the sessions on time.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">What are the times again?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Id est, though an optimisation survey.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I must point out to delegates that it isn't required of you to attend all 3 sessions.
Deleted User: 
I know, but I would like to.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
May I remind Mr. Chair that the official initialisation of Universal Coordinated Time is UTC.

They are merely to serve as a means for more people to attend a session.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Or at least I hope.
Apologies, my wifi is being rather slow.
Next up we will discuss the dates for our upcoming events.
Currently, we have planned:
I wish to run these before the end of my term, so we'll need to decide on formal dates for all of these.
Also I must include the awards evening.
The floor is open to discussion regarding dates.
For the 100th session, because this will be a European session it should take place on Friday in 2 weeks time.
I reckon that 18 June should be a good time for the 100th session - afterall I reckon that it's possible.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I am not worried about the dates, the exact time concernes me more, as I live in a different timezone than most of other delegates.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The CA-GUM cleanup can take place at any time really, but we need to discuss this with the GUM.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Which timezone?
Sander I - Revalia: 
GMT+2
It's same as UTC+2
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What is the CA-GUM cleanup?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's my concern - our delegation is spread across lots of different timezones.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
All the british delegates are only an hour behind, this should be OK if we hold it around 19:00 UTC
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">What is the CA-GUM cleanup?
Sander I - Revalia: 
Indeed.
But think of asian and american delegates too.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">All the british delegates are only an hour behind, this should be OK if we hold it around 19:00 UTC
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I still think the 100th meeting might be better suited on a weekend for the American delegates.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It will be a fairly long event so it should work better that way.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's kind of awkward trying to deal with a massive range of TZs.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I’m also worried about times for a European session.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It would be 7 am my time.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">It's kind of awkward trying to deal with a massive range of TZs.
Would it be plausible to host it as 3 different parts over the course of a day?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Maybe another survey.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Environmental? How would that work?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Perhaps have one part open to the wider community?
Sander I - Revalia: 
Yes, that is a good idea.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Picking up litter, etc.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Environmental? How would that work?
If we host it on a Saturday then I will only be able to present the final section in the evening.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, I know, but logistically speaking.
Deleted User: 
Yes. Good idea
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm thinking of:
Section 2: European (evening)
Section 3: American (night)
This works via UTC.
E.g. 13:00 UTC, 20:00 UTC and 22:00 UTC.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah that’s fine with me.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Gonna be honest, I don't want to pick up trash at night
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This isn't about the cleanup.
The cleanup will take place over the course of a day.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Oh a summit at night
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes.
This is for the 100th session.
Or super session if you will.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Seems fine by me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
I will discuss this later with the ministers to see what they say about these session times.
Deleted User: 
Nothing from Burdette.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Otherwise I am very exited for these upcoming events and our chance to show off the CA to the wider community.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I assume we are given sufficient information on the summit right before it begins?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Is there a programme for it?
As in, one that is a little out of normal.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The summit is currently under development so there won't be one until the week before.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Seems good.
I am excited for it.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
On the topic of the cleanup
Can we ask delegates to weigh all the trash they collect?
And then add it all together for a final total?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I was actually going to suggest that instead of just sending in photos.
We will encourage delegates to weigh their rubbish if possible.
Next up we have the expulsion of Huai Siao.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The cleanup regards the member nations, correct?
Sorry, I didn't see that we had moved on.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Earlier this morning delegates brought to my attention that Huai Siao has been inactive since their proposed expulsion.
<div class="quote">The cleanup regards the member nations, correct?
Again I apologise, my wifi is being very slow tonight.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
May I continue before we move by?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Back on topic, I understand that they are not native English speakers which creates issues for their delegation and communication.
The floor is open to discussion.
<div class="quote">May I continue before we move by?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Does the cleanup equally regard individual delegates who do not live in any member nation of the CA nor the GUM?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
No because it only concerns GUM/CA delegates.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Noted, thank you.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unless they serve as a delegate to a GUM/CA nation.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I think we got the question a little mixed up.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't believe that I understood your question so I apologise.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Say, if I were to participate, however I live in Norway and in no member state to clean up, would it be possible for me to participate?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
So long as it's a delegate partaking it's fine by me.
Back on topic, the floor is open regarding the expulsion of Huai Siao.

Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Huai Siao should be expelled.
They have not cleaned up their act from when you contacted them.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
CosmicElephants: 
What did they do?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They have shown to 1 session, in November.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I must sadly concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">They have not cleaned up their act from when you contacted them.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They didn't even declare themselves present in that session...
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I'd say that is the smallest problem.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The fact we expel people based on being inactive for 2-3 months, 8 months raises questions.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Would it not be for the Asian &amp; Oceanian minister to straighten up things?
Deleted User: 
I concur, Huai Siao should definitely be expelled from the Cupertino Alliance.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As my computer has just crashed, I will be unable to proceed with this session until it has reloaded.
We will continue discussing the expulsion until it has reloaded in the meantime.
I apologise for any inconvenience.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Also, there was a minstrel order put out.

Update: it's sorted out and we can now continue.
Anybody wish to add anything further regarding this motion before we move on?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Apologies for my absence, but I also support this nation's expulsion.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright we shall move on.
Next up we have the revitalisation of the Quality Picture project.
Do you wish to speak on behalf of this motion?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Could this be delayed for a minute or two?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I will be away from my computer for a short amount of time.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We shall move onto the next item.
Next up we have the GreenCities Guides.
I mentioned this a few weeks ago, so I feel like formally discussing it here.
For those who haven't seen the motion before, essentially it would be a series of guides like the Cupertino Guides which will discuss how to grow and care for your own plants, including basic information such as soil types or other things.
The floor is open to discussion.
We can in theory use our knowledge and experience from the Cupertino Guides project in order to complete this project.
It can also be run via guides.micronations.wiki.

I don't have much to say about this initiative, in all honesty.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's fine.
Unless anybody wishes to add anything further we shall move on?
I'll leave the Greencities revitalisation motion until a later date.
We shall return back to the Quality picture motion once Leon returns.

Are you available to discuss the item?
Else we shall move onto applications.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Sorry, I have been unannounced away for a little while.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
My proposal is to revive the Glasgow Project.
Photography is very important, and I believe that we should appreciate it more.
I cede the floor.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
I agree with the revitalisation of the Glasgow Project, as this was something that I ran during my time as Minister of MicroWiki Affairs.
Unfortunately it seems to have been forgotten by the current minister.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Deleted User: 
Nothing from Burdette.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Who is the current minister?
Deleted User: 
Sertor Valentinus.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I see.
I would be willing to run the program, if the Minister responsible agrees.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd recommend discussing it with Sertor post-session.

I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Considering your knowledge with photography, I believe that you would be a good candidate to run the project.
Moving onto applications.

Aren't they highly unstable, as part of the ... infamous Fesmar sector?

I cede.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Ministry of Asian and Oceanian Affairs decides the time of their sessions, or so that is how it was intended to be.

I would ask the Honourable Chair to speak on this matter first.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thank you.
As you may already know, we are planning to host an environmental clean-up involving the GUM. Considering that we are the leading organisation with this project, we need to decide on a final date to host this. This can then be forwarded towards the GUM's administration for their approval.
So suggestions for dates to host this on (preferably within the next 2 weeks) will be helpful.
I cede the floor.

May I have the floor, Mr. Speaker?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra:

You may speak.

After all, what else do we need to do? advertising? creating a guide for the event?

As Huai Siao has attended very little sessions, I support the expulsion.
I cede.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
May I have the floor?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, Mr. Gladden.
I would would inform that the main issue with Huai Siao is language barrier.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I must point out that language might be a barrier, however we cannot make exceptions to nations for inactivity due to language.
Deleted User: 
As Mr. Neal stated yesterday, we usually consider expulsion after 2-3 months of inactivity. Huai Siao has attended 1 session in total, and they have not since attended a session in 8 months. 8 months! I know they are not native English speakers, but good lord, 8 months of inactivity? The expulsion has my support.
Sander I - Revalia: 
They can handle it like Queensland does; using google translate and doing a lot of mistakes.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes. They do the same however, they have not attended sessions which is concerning.
Sander I - Revalia:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This is essentially the same case as the CA-GUM clean-up but with our other events, including the digital summit (100th session), awards evening, informal fun events, etc.
As the digital summit will be the 100th session, this means that the date will be sometime in the next 2-3 weeks.
Overall I wish to conduct all of these events before my tenure ends, so I'd like to conduct all of these within the next 2 months.
If people could suggest dates for these events that would be great.
I cede.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you very much.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that hosting the awards evening within the closing days of my term would be a nice conclusion.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur; it is a splendid idea.
Deleted User: 
I also concur.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Will the award evening be a part of the 100th session or what?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I'd like to keep the awards evening seperate.
Partially because it'll be a long event (1-2 hours)

May I ask that you elaborate?

Yes, please elaborate.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Pardon my lack of knowledge on the delegate's question, could you elaborate a bit?
It is related to the Glasgow Project that is what i have been able to grab.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Essentially Leon Montan will be taking control and running the previously-inactive Glasgow Project, so we'd like to hear your thoughts on this.
Deleted User: 
Sounds good to me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
What is the Glasgow Project?
Apart from knowing Glasgow is in Scotland and it hosted the Commonwealth Games in 2014, I know nothing on it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The Glasgow Project is the Quality Pictures project.
Deleted User: 
Essentially, the Glasgow Project is a photography project, aiming to show off micronations with pictures. (I'm not 100% educated, so bare with me.)
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Ahh
Ok
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's pretty much what it is.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Seems like a not bad idea.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does anyone wish to speak on the said matter? or we may move on.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Well, a revival in a project means continuation in activity, which I'm all for.

Remarks.
The only think coming to my mind regarding this nation is when I interacted with their delegate last summer, he informed on being at war or something.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I am fully in support of this applicant.
They are fairly old and look rather professional.
Their MicroWiki page looks good too.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Permission was to be sought.
Anyone else wishes to speak on it?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I mean the floor is usually open to all for applications.
Deleted User: 
I would like to ask a question about the application process. May I have the floor?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I announced something before we begin with the session.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, sure.

After the three readings an applicant gets, when does the vote happen?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes. Once the three readings are done, the Chair or staff member puts them to vote.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The next on the agenda is the second reading of the Kingdom of Oskonia.
Kingdom of Oskonia</div>
The Kingdom of Oskonia, commonly known as Oskonia, is an autonomous territorial entity that claims to be a sovereign state, but is commonly referred to as a micronation by external observers.

Definitely support from my end.
Deleted User: 
As the applicant, I will be stepping away from discussion on this applicant.
...but full support.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
However, the main concern is that I have seen a lot of nations being fairly active in the beginning months but later on they gradually decrease activities and within some time they dissolve. However, Australis &amp; Atiera are the best examples of those prospered.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Oskonia would definitely be an incredible part of the alliance
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
They look very professional and active.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I observe that Oskonia is on its way to become a respectable nation in the community, such as what I have rightfully predicted with Atiera earlier on. So support from me as well taking into account all aspects feeding into its gradual prosperity.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A support from me.
Sander I - Revalia: 
And epic.
Deleted User: 
Decorum, Mr. Koff.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Epic is a word.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Members are asked to maintain decorum and seek permission before speaking.
Members.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Not slang.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Koff? Are you the session chair?
I am asking for you to seek permission before speaking.
Sander I - Revalia: 
May I?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would allow the word Epic to be kept in records and it is fairly an ordinary formal word.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, you may.
Sander I - Revalia: 
When I stated Oskinia is epic I was trying to give my opinion that I like them in one word. If it broke the rules, I am very sorry. I cede.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I don' think it did. 
The next on the agenda is the division on Belgica
Members may discuss on this nation having sought permission.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
May I?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Belgica has existed for a few years and has had trouble exiting an isolated sector within the community. Assisting them in doing so by admitting them to the alliance would be greatly benefitial for them and for us, I believe. I know this having observed it's activity in 2019 and early 2020.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If I may?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Therefore I express full support for their admission, I cede.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, Mr. Chair, you may.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you, it is valuable.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
For while I believe that they are associated with the Fesmar group and their short lifespans, I would be willing to give them a chance as observers to prove themselves.
And for all we know they may improve themselves as members.
I cede.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you.
Do any one else wish to speak on this application?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
If I may, again.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, you may.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Duly noted.
Thanks for the presence.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The Chair is correct in that, however I observe that Belgica has shown to carry through without major changes to their existance, and thus exist in the status today nearly identical to the one by which they were founded with few changes along the way. Belgica has a lot to learn from the community and I believe it is in their and our best interest that they are given a chance to prove competence.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you Mr. Miller.
Does anyone wish to add anything?
Sander I - Revalia: 
Nothing from me.
Deleted User: 
Nothing from me.
Anthony I - Saspearian:

There is nothing more on the agenda.
The floor is open for all.
Can you brief for Vishwamitra?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
We had a successful Parliament session last night.
Deleted User: 
Burdette became a provisional member of the GUM.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra has engaged relations between themselves and <s>West</s> Sayville, and is planning ahead to celebrate the first annual monarchy day on the 8th of this month.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Sayville. We have ties with KWS since March.
Sander I - Revalia: 
In Revalia, nothing big is going on.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
In addition, we released a medal today and Mr. Christopher Miller was on 25th of May appointed as President of the Privy Council while Union Home Minister Farhaz Hazarika has been named as the next Prime Minister.
Deleted User: 
Uhh, Oskonia has new Assembly of State members??
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Members talks and updates.

Ok
Sander I - Revalia: 
Can Lincolnshire project help in making a currency too?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am unsure.
Deleted User: 
What is the Lincolnshire Project?
Anyone?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It is a project helping members with coats of arms, flags, etc. Designs etc.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Who is the head of the project?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Jayden Lycon or the Chair himself.
If no one else has anything to speak or discuss.
We may end the session right now.

Hello everyone and welcome to the 94th session of the Cupertino Alliance.
Here is our agenda for today. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rCOPqz0vAndgD_08fbAC9je1eQAbTzyXwr9hcSfVDeU/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1rCOPqz0vAndgD_08fbAC9je1eQAbTzyXwr9hcSfVDeU/edit</a>

The 94th session is a American Session scheduled  to be hosted on 6 June 2021 at 9P...</div>
Our first item on the agenda is the discussion on the August 2021 election timeline.
In the 92nd session the Chair talked about the election campaign period running from the 16th of July to the 12th of August.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qalfana int present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I believe this will relieve some stress having designated times.
I cede the floor.
Deleted User: 
Do we have to request the floor?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Not at the moment.
Deleted User: 
I stated this is the last session; I think that the timeline is good as is.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Would any other delegates wish to speak on this topic?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Seems good
Sander I - Revalia: 
Seems good
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I concur
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, moving on.
Next we have the discussion about the planning of the Improved American &amp; Asian session times.
Basically, timing for the American and Asian sessions have been bad to delegates in these groups.
We ran a session optimization time a couple of months back, but since then has been unoptimized.
Basically, I want a idea of times that work for us.
I cede the floor.
I notice time and time again in announcements it's always almost a tie or worse when reminders about sessions go out.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Is there any times that you can do?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
It is to note that some members may not react to the poll
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True, we have to take that into account.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Is anyone able to add anything?
Deleted User: 
Nothing from me.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Nothing from me either.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is Present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, moving on.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Wait
May I input on the topic of better times?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
The Imperial Grand Duchy of Lundenwic is present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">May I input on the topic of better times?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Well, for myself, having an active school and after school activities, the only times that fit for me would be between 4:30-8 pm AEST, on weekends however I am quite fine with any time.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Thanks.
Next we have the discuss the Finalization of the date for the GUM-CA cleanup.
May I ask you the Chair to go into a bit of detail?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Sure.
During the last session, we finalised the dates which this will be hosted on, which will be 12 - 13 June.
I have discussed this with Jack Dean, and he has stated that he is fine with this.
All that really needs doing now is creating posters.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What exactly is the cleanup?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I invite as many delegates to try their hand at creating posters, which I'd recommend you do with these palletes however any colours will be fine.
Decent quality posters will be adopted as the official posters for the clean-up.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I believe it is generally just picking up trash, and I also heard about weighing the trash. \
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Finally, I'd like to discuss potentially opening this up to Sough2020 signatories.
I cede the floor.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Sough2020 signatories?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">What exactly is the cleanup?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Is that a group you own?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Would this cleanup mean cleaning up our particular micronations, or the surrounding Macronation as well?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What posters?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Sough2020">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Sough2020</a> Environmental treaty that I led last year.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Would delegates be open to the idea of involving Sough2020 signatories?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, I welcome it.
Deleted User: 
Sure, seems like a great idea. Bringing more people together to clean up their environment is always a good idea.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, moving on.
Next, on the Expulsion of Huai Siao.
It is depressing to say the least, but they haven't really worked at all on the CA.
They have not showed to any meeting in the last 8 months.
Deleted User: 
They have attended one session in an eight-month time period. The expulsion has my full support.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
And they have gotten many warnings.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I think the answer to this is very clear.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This expulsion has my support aswell.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Unfortunately, we will have to expel them.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Agreed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Any other delegates wish to bring anything up on the talk of Huai Siao?
James B. - Desert District: 
I support the expulsion.
Deleted User: 
I also support the expulsion.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I cannot argue against their expulsion.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Next we have to Finalise dates for future events.
Are you able to talk on this?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I support the expulsion.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, I am going to assume the Chair is out.
What I know is that the digital summit is supposed to happen in 2-3 weeks.
The Chair wishes to get multiple events out before the end of his tenure, so speaking on last session he wishes for us to suggest dates.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I apologise however I am rather busy right now.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It is alright.
I cede the floor.
I believe that the digital summit should be hosted on a non business day, like Saturday or Sunday.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Probably for the best.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Maybe we should host something like a survey, because we need the general public opinion on it.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What would be discussed on this digital summit.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It would be a combination of the 100th session.
I currently do not know what we would do, but I heard that we are going to break it up into 3 parts.
Morning, evening and night.
E.g. 13:00 UTC, 20:00 UTC and 22:00 UTC.
Of course the times I posted are examples, we can work around the Session Optimization Survey.
We also discussed having it as a VC in something like Zoom, Discord or Google Meets.
I think maybe on Sunday is good.
June 20th?
Can any delegate speak on this?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
That seems fine to me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Moving on.
Next we have the discussion of the Quality Picture revival.
The Quality Picture program (Glasgow Project) was a program ran by Leon Montan.
What it entailed was taking pictures of your nation.
I think this project could and should be revived, it really brought out the beauty of nations.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Wesr Sayville is present.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
May I speak?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Go ahead.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I said earlier today as well; revival of this project means a continuation of activity, which I support. On these grounds I cannot find any good reason not to continue it. It seems like a fun thing to move ahead with.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
May I have the floor?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
And may I after?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes after.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
The Glasgow Project has already been revived, after a short discussion with the Minister responsible- I am now in charge of the project, and I intend on dedicating time to it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Great.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
If anyone would like to submit an image, here is the link to do so.
Nominate</div>
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Just to clarify, do all pictures count? Or are you just after nature? I ask because Lundenwic is rather small and doesn't have much in the way of greenery.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Checking other nominees, it just has to be a nice picture taken inside your nation.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Thank you.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Anyone wish to add anything before we move on?
Moving on to the best part, Membership time!

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
May I afterwards?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes after.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I would like to state that Oskonia is a really young micronation, and considering it's so young, they have progressed very fastly. A full support from me. I cede.
Deleted User: 
As the applicant, I will step away from further discussion.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, I believe the age does not matter if they have shown progression like this.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
As the delegate for Revalia states, Oskonia has quickly progressed and become known and respected by many honourable delegates and member states within this alliance. Oskonia has early on employed the characteristics of a successful state and it would be silly not to let them in.
Full support from my side, I cede.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I fully support it too.
Any other comments before we move on?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
None from me.
Sander I - Revalia: 
None from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Next we have Belgica
Members may discuss on this nation having sought permission.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Absolutely not for this nation.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
May I?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Go ahead.
I can see this nation going out easily from the stability of it.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Belgica has existed for a few years and has had trouble exiting an isolated sector within the community. Assisting them in doing so by admitting them to the alliance would be greatly benefitial for them and for us, I believe. I know this having observed it's activity in 2019 and early 2020.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I have said on the session earlier today as well; Belgica has existed for a few years and has gained experience during so. Having observed it's activities myself in 2019 and early 2020 I have seen that it has struggled substantially to exit it's isolated bubble within the community in which it existed inside of along with other infamous nations such as Fesmar. However given the instability in its surroundings and environment, Belgica has always remained mostly stable and it exists in a condition today nearly identical of the one by which it was founded in early 2019.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Belgica has a lot to learn from this community, I had said earlier. And in its improvement in the recent year, having localised almost entirely. The outdated wiki reflects barely anything upon what it is, or what I believe it is based on my observations.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, I think possibly a chance at observership.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
For starters.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Anyone else wants to add anything?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Giving them a chance would be for the benefit of them and for us, I cede.

When does the voting on each nation start?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

Thank you mr. Speaker. I have no previous experience with the Sun Republic however I see that it has engaged relations with Regelis. On my part, Regelis, both as an observer state, and a state I have observed, knows what they are doing and do not mess around with international relations. So Sun Republic is a yes from me based on that. I cede.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Yes from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well aside from that Regelis was expelled on inactivity from the CA.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Ah ok, I didn't know. Regardless of their activity my point stands.

We may also try participating. Our turnout might be rather low though.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I'll probably participate on behalf of Ponderosa Hills.
Deleted User: 
I may be able to participate on behalf of Burdette.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">We may also try participating. Our turnout might be rather low though.
I intend to participate on behalf of Aenopia on sunday.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Monmark is present.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens will likely participate at some point during the week
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I will attempt to participate on behalf of Northwood-Oregon, should transportation not stop me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
By the looks of things, we should have enough people participating to make it worthwhile (excluding GUM delegates).
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I will try to participate on behalf of myself.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Other than that, I am very exited for this clean-up as it is something that I have been planning since last year.
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Alright I'll presume that as a no.
Deleted User: 
Correct.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Moving on, I would like to alert delegates that my leave of absence which I was planning for the next 2 weeks has been postponed by at least 1 week due to COVID.
This means that I should have more time to continue to plan our upcoming events.
Moving onto my next motion, we have the proposal for the writing of a new parliamentary code: <a href="https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kitnwdDHx9x2ps5utjkjMHWkHTQG-xZS/view">https://drive.google.com/file/d/1kitnwdDHx9x2ps5utjkjMHWkHTQG-xZS/view</a>
Guide to annoucing, hosting, and managing sessions, first edition.pdf</div>
The original code was written during Lycon's tenure in 2020, which means that it is rather outdated.
As a result of this, I think that we should produce a new edition in order to better suit the current, and indeed future administrations.
The floor is open to discussion.

Warmedic - Monmark: 
I see several comments have been made on the Google Document.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
How is it outdated?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
How out of date could they be?
Deleted User: 
I think it is fine.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
Unless their is a genuine reason to update it I see no reason for the need top. Its not a year old yet.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I'm not sure they are outdated, but these new guidelines are rather nice looking.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that it's more a case of a new edition being required due to older practices that have fallen out of favour.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Could it be that this document simply needs reviewing?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Do you think you could explain the proposal?
<div class="quote">Could it be that this document simply needs reviewing?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Can we move onto our next item on the agenda?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that Jayden will not be explaining the proposal then.
If nobody wishes to add anything further then we'll move on.
Finally we have the events for the upcoming digital summit which we need to decide on.
As you all know from previous sessions, the digital summit will be hosted as the 100th session, which means that we only have a few weeks to plan it.
As a result, we need to decide on items which will be discussed/events that will take place throughout the summit.
The floor is open to proposals.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I have voiced my support for hosting an informal event post-session involving games like Gartic, Scribbl.io, etc.
Other people have previously suggested guest speakers, so we should decide on who we should invite.
What topics should be discussed?
Should we have presentations for member states?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Perhaps we could have members give short presentations about their nations. This will albeit be similar to the Birmingham Summit, but it might help each member state express their talents and properly introduce themselves to each other.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I ask for clarification: is this the 24 hour session?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This is the digital summit.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Presentations from nations would be a nice filler at the end.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
Depending on the length of the summit I think a range of talks from individuals within the Organisation, as well as without, ending with an informal session so as to encourage friendship and camaraderie within members.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Perhaps we could have members give short presentations about their nations. This will albeit be similar to the Birmingham Summit, but it might help each member state express their talents and properly introduce themselves to each other.
Warmedic - Monmark:

I currently don't have plans for a 24 summit due to the GUM's version being a thing.
Deleted User: 
I concur with my fellow Burdette delegate.

This is a great idea to help members network.

Perhaps we could sign some sort of agreement/treaty between members?
Deleted User: 
Can this also apply to observers, or not?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Realistically we won't be able to host a significant event like the Birmingham summit for quite a while, so this will probably be the best that we can do until then.
<div class="quote">Can this also apply to observers, or not?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
As it will be public and is somewhat promotional, we should include a few attractive topics. Maybe announce the winner of a giveaway and/or give out some awards. We could also give updates on attractive programs like Twin Cities and Green Cities
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This be difficult to find a topic that all member states agree on. Also, we physically sign documents, which might cause a problem.

May I ask what week this will be hosted? I wish to attend, but will be taking a leave of absence from 27 June to 10 July.

I would be open to this.

That could be cool. But I was recommending two geographically nearby nations meet during the session and sign a treaty of some sort.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
We could mail a treaty and have everyone sign?

I would also be open to this.

This will be a genuine concern for many.

Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
For member state presentations, it would be cool if each member could have 5-8 minutes to introduce themselves and show a bit of recent development, like a verbal capstone tribune article.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that this will likely be hosted in 2 weeks time, however if we are running behind schedule then I will push it back by a week or 2.

I've already looked into this micronation; hard no from me.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Definite no. I think the state of their wiki article says enough.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Hard no from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
The MW page is very hard to understand, It could do with considerable work.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their page is quite simply poor.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Fairly new server?
Seems to only have 1 member.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Are they a member of the CASC server or does anybody have access to their discord info?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
MicroWiki is not conclusive.
No.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
They may be a member of GUM-MDI I think.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Excuse me a moment.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'll take a look - if we decide to reject them then I will direct them to the CASC server.

Alright then let's begin.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
First off we have the CAoNI revitalisation.
Unfortunately the project has fallen back into inactivity during the last few months due to a lack of interest in the project.
As a result I believe that we should figure out how to bring activity into the project and encourage delegates to participate.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The floor is open to discussion.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What is the project exactly?

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I'm not sure why the project is inactive in comparison to the Twin Towns project which is incredibly active.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Given more detail about the project so that I could better understand it, Lurdentania would be happy to participate.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
(Intermittently.)
Deleted User: 
(int. as well)
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Could we potentially advertise it towards members of the community? Should we water the project down and simplify it a little to make it more appealing?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes.
More understandable in a way.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is intermittently present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Yes.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What do you mean?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Are you referring to advertisement or simplifying?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I mean, when I was reading the induction I was somewhat lost and misunderstood many sorts. Simplifying the project would allow for member states to participate with an informed mindset.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's fair enough.
Should we remove the pairing part of the project in exchange for the Twin Towns project?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes.
And, possibly even the biggest change I would suggest, is to simplify the entire name of the Project.

<div class="quote">And, possibly even the biggest change I would suggest, is to simplify the entire name of the Project.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think this would be a good idea to make both more unique.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I mean the TT project mainly fills in the partnership part of the project.
So I guess that it's fine without it.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
If I understand this correctly, the project aims to connect two natural areas with one another from different micronations, to be connected, which aims to boost diplomatic and cultural connections?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes that's correct.
So essentially the TT project but with natural spaces.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Interesting.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As we seem to be getting nowhere, should we move onto the next item?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Could I maybe make a suggestion?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Go ahead.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Would it be a good idea, to turn this project of discussion into a regional project between micronations? This way, micronations partnered together can trade any produce, plants or anything else which could be produced by their land?
This would increase in real life connections between different micronation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That would actually be very interesting, however I believe that postage and addresses may be an issue.
Other than that I would probably support the idea.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Good point. Another good thing of the idea would be to connect more micronations regionally, and create an atmosphere where micronationalists can meet in Person.
Anyway.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that we should move on other than that.
Next up we have the ongoing GUM-CA clean-up.
You may have already seen the superb efforts by some delegates to clean up their local nations, so I must thank and congratulate everybody who has participated so far.
I will post some images in a moment however I must remind everyone that the event will continue to run until tomorrow, however if people require more time I will allow for an extension.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
So the event is still occurring?

Great to hear.
I will now be handing over to Thorin Neal, who will continue with the session.

Thank you Mr. Chair
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Noted, bye.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Elaborate.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Our timetable right now is 
Basically we need to understand what we are going to discuss.
We have the timetable but no actual items.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
When is this summit?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
All I understand is we have about 2-3 weeks.
It is merged with our 100th session.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think that time table looks good.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
We need items like presentations, and such.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Maybe we could take items from the agendas of the 97th, 98th and 99th sessions, making them shorter and add them to the summit?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True, that is actually a great thought.
I doubt just the 100th session would yield well, so making short session from 97th, 98th and 99th would be great.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I'll bring that up to the Chair.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Decorum.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Thank you.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Anyone wish to add anything before we move on to membership time?
Rory - Lurdentania:

Rory - Lurdentania: 
For this topic, I would like to know, if possible, we could have a Presiding Officer and a Deputy Presiding Officer/clerk. Assuming the session would be a long session and have no written records of the discussion, a clerk would be needed to write down the members present, the minutes etc.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think that it should be possible, like Logan hosting and then the ministers of different regions (Like Me, Daniel) help on that.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yeah.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright we have 1 application.

No remarks.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
No from me, they don't seem to have any physical claims aside from a jar of rocks and a minecraft server.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
My first look at it, no for me.
It simply seems like a joke.
There is no organization it seems.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
It’s a nation of drawings, rock provinces and gaming? It’s a no from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
 Salanda history Salandarians originally did settle on an island in a Minecraft world but soon after the world became unavailable to access. Salandarians then used another world which is the one that is used to represent Salanda to day to live on Salandarians also collected Rocks and stones to make the Salanda Micronation in Real life. Both form the Modern day micronation of The Kingdom Of Salanda. Nowadays The kingdom of Salanda actively tries to establish peace efforts as well as building bridges of diplomacy with other micronations.
What..?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Do they know what the return key does?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Do they know what professionalism is?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah I don't think they are at all fit for the CA.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
they seem to claim the entire town of Hendon, west london.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We rejected members before for much less.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Hendon isn't even a nice place.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
 The Kingdom of Salanda also does not recognise the following of this self declared states: The state of palestine (belongs to Israel)
Alright.
Just no.

Are we ignoring the fact they're claiming over 30,000 people without their knowledge/will?

No from Oskonia.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Unprofessionalism, bogus claims.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hard no, wish they didn't even apply.
Anyone wish to add anything else before we close out?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
It’s a no from myself.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Maybe they'd be a better fit for the Progressive Association.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah they added actual politics also.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
How do you have politics in a box of stones?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don't even know.

That is if delegates are in support.
Onwards regarding the formal discussion, I believe that one thing we should be primarily discussing are present matters in the community, so any suggestions would be helpful.
We can plan some items, however it would be in the best interests of everyone to retain the ability to discuss anything on the spot.
Also I again remind delegates that the floor is open to discussion.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I think we should delegate 30 minutes to the formal discussion.
Although that is a tad off topic.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
When is the date of this session? The issue of planning discussions of present matters... is that they may no longer be relevant by the time the session is hosted.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">When is the date of this session? The issue of planning discussions of present matters... is that they may no longer be relevant by the time the session is hosted.
I would also like to reiterate that we can discuss anything during the session if something pops up during the next week.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
What time on 25 June?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I think we should delegate 30 minutes to the formal discussion.
I think that we would be best to start it at 16:00 UTC and allow for people to enter whenever they can.
However this means that I will only be chairing the first 2 hours for a short time.
The ideal time for me would be the usual time of 19:00.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Any other suggestions for time would be good.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I cannot guarantee my attendance at this stage in time, as I am getting a new job in a few days.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Mats - Belgica: 
I think 16:00 UTC is a good time, most of the people in Europe are already home by that time.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed; it caters not only for European members of the community but also a few American individuals.
Unless anybody wishes to add anything further to this item we shall move on.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That's about 11 AM my time which is decent.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Items for discussion during this point in the event will be very helpful.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
What treaties will be signed during the session?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Moving onto my next item, I would like to plan the treaty.
<div class="quote">What treaties will be signed during the session?
I believe that we should either:
Personally I am in support of option A), as it would allow for a more unique experience.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Do we have any existing ideas for a new treaty?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
However, it would be more time consuming.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'd support option A.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Do we have any existing ideas for a new treaty?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
We could also mail it to every nation who is wiling after the session to sign.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If we decide to go with option A, we shall require ideas for the treaty and what it shall cover.
<div class="quote">We could also mail it to every nation who is wiling after the session.
In regards to ideas, what should we cover? Territorial disputes? Environmental protection? Human rights?

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Mats - Belgica: 
I think Enviromental protection would be nice.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that covering territorial disputes and the correct manner to deal with these would be good considering that there aren't many treaties focusing on this.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Territorial disputes would be an interesting thing to cover.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
There is the Sough2020 treaty but that doesn't force anything.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I think Enviromental protection would be nice.
<div class="quote">There is the Sough2020 treaty but that doesn't force anything.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I mean it's optional to sign and if you sign a treaty usually you should abide by it.
It's not really forcing if they consent to abiding by it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
If we decide to create a treaty focusing on territorial disputes, then maybe we could do something like the UN Convention on the Law of the Sea? <a href="https://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/08/8-01/unclos.xml">https://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/08/8-01/unclos.xml</a>
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) - The Facu...</div>
Read this story on the University of Oslo's website.</div>
I believe that we should cover items including:
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Perhaps... e-Mail?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
-What doesn't define as a territorial dispute, eg. an accidental movement of nationals through Y nation?
Mats - Belgica: 
When 2 or more political entities claim the same location/territory.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Perhaps... e-Mail?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That also works.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">When 2 or more political entities claim the same location/territory.
Maybe we could also cover something like this as part of the treaty? <a href="https://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/08/8-01/unclos.xml#treaty-header1-12">https://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/08/8-01/unclos.xml#treaty-header1-12</a>
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) - The Facu...</div>
Read this story on the University of Oslo's website.</div>
But more land/territory based.
Settlement of disputes is something that will be very important regarding the treaty as well. <a href="https://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/08/8-01/unclos.xml#treaty-header1-15">https://www.jus.uio.no/english/services/library/treaties/08/8-01/unclos.xml#treaty-header1-15</a>
United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS) - The Facu...</div>
Read this story on the University of Oslo's website.</div>
Does anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Mats - Belgica: 
We could create a council to help solve disputes(if that isnt already established)
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That would be the role of the Supreme Court I guess.
Before we move on, I would like to quickly propose that we create a group of delegates that will handle the creation of this treaty.
If you are interested in assisting with the creation of this treaty, then please state so now.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Finally, I would like to touch on the presentation part of the session.
I would like to plan the amount of time allocated towards each presentation during this session, as we shouldn't require much other items.
We already have a form for presentation applications if you are interested, and I will begin to circulate it across the community following this session. <a href="https://forms.gle/1sU5qhKjYZsZVdfB7">https://forms.gle/1sU5qhKjYZsZVdfB7</a>
Cupertino digital summit Presentation application</div>
The floor is open to discussion.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is temporarily present; apologies for the absence.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I believe that 10-15 minutes per presentation sounds good.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
i concur.
Mats - Belgica: 
I do as well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We should have a 30 minutes contingency slot following the presentation time as well.
Else we will end up running behind if someone is having issues/takes more time than expected.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from West Sayville.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
None from Wendatia
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then, that concludes this evening's session planning.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
That sounds reasonable
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We shall move onto applications.
The Kingdom of Salanda 
Kingdom of Salanda</div>
Salanda, officially the Kingdom of Salanda (TKOS), is a micronation founded in early 2018; it was officially established on the 22nd June 2018, which is now celebrated as The Kingdom Of Salanda Independence Day.

Third reading.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Hard pass.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The floor is open to discussion.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
<strong>It's a box of rocks.</strong>
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their page has gotten much better since last week, however it's sill a hard pass from me.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I agree
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
I believe that anything that needs saying has been said by this point.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I don't mind micronations like this; in fact, i think the only claims we should prevent are in Bir Tawil and Antarctica
Im in support of their application
Mats - Belgica: 
I would be a hypocrite if I would comment on their page, as the wiki page of the micronation that I represent needs an upgrade as well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Couldn't agree more.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I personally think that's irrelevant.
James B. - Desert District: 
I believe our purpose is to help develop nations, so let’s help them.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'm very opposed.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Iconcur
James B. - Desert District: 
I will support them.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
They are lying about citizens so no from me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
They claim the entirety of a north london suburb regardless of what the locals think about it
And not even one of the nice suburbs.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
do you have p roof they didn't ask?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that we should give them a chance to develop before we admit them.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
do you really think a guy with a box of rocks would ask 35,000 people to join his box of rocks
Mats - Belgica: 
I think that someone should message them, and tell them what they should improve and when they have improved they should apply again.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
A suburb's niceness isn't relevant. My nation is currently in the process of a bill that will c'aim a desolate detroit suburb with no one in it.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
So Jonas do you actually believe that they have 35,000 citizens?
Mats - Belgica: 
Does anyone have their discord information?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that it's worth moving on by this point.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I personally think that most of these citizens are minecraft mobs.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Let me find Hendon's local government website to see if they think it's part of the UK or part of a box of rocks.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
<div class="quote">Hendon territories, The Kingdom of Salanda is the name of territory annexed and acquired by The Kingdom of Salanda on Wednesday 2nd June 2021. Before annexation and acquirement of The Kingdom of Salanda it used to be Hendon, London, England, U.K but now it is Hendon Territories. The Kingdom of Salanda. It’s population is 35,872 and in the latest Salanda census it’s population is included in The Kingdom of Salanda’s population.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright swiftly moving on.
Republic of Floriland
Floriland</div>
the Republic of Floriland, more commonly known as simply Floriland, is a sovereign state, called a micronation by external observers, consisting of multiple non-contiguous pieces of land.</div>
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
There Minister of Foreign Affairs has done some concerning things...
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
What have they done?
Otherwise I'll be abstaining at best.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Ah.
Definitely an oppose then.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Oh dear.
Almendria, was that one of Afra's pals?
Or was that Tizian?
Mats - Belgica: 
Is the user in the photo actually the alt of John Lakes, because if so, John Lakes leads Floriland.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Tizian I believe.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Ah, Mr. Aruna.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Tizian
and Kazzi
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Yeah, definite no.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Let's not associate with their ilk.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
ill be abstaining
Mats - Belgica: 
I will as well
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I will be opposing.
Other than that, does anybody wish to add anything further?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
No.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright I'll give a 5 minute grace period before we conclude for this evening.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Nothing more from Waterside Park.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
None from myself
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As it has been 5 minutes I hereby adjourn this evening's session.

Right, as I said previously, today we're just going to be discussing plans for the upcoming summit. This is a big deal, so I'd appreciate something more than just concurrences. Feel free to contribute your ideas. 
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Mr. Speaker, Mr. Ross said he would not be present for this session.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If we needed assistance with an item I was to ping him.
We'll loop back around to him if he comes back.
We need to establish some items of discussion for the summit. This could be talks from delegates regarding various things, or activities related to micronationalism organised by delegates.
Does anyone have any ideas on some topics of discussion?
I'd be willing to do a talk about Australis.

Hmmm, maybe some kind of competition between micronations?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Also on the agenda is discussion for informal activities that we could do following the end of the formal part of the summit.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I notice that I have been pinged.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think Mr. Gladden's point fits into this category, and I'd support competitions happening.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes - It was regarding the treaty.
Deleted User: 
Ahh, great. Please read this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">However, first up we'll be discussing a treaty to take place during the summit. I think @Logan Ross - Aenopia could elaborate?
Right now our current themes that we have chosen are:
-Environmental treaty like Sough2020
We can either discuss other themes or decide on one of these two.
Then we need to decide on what the treaty will consist of.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I don't think we need another environmental treaty.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unless anybody has any questions I shall cede the floor.
<div class="quote">I don't think we need another environmental treaty.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I mean any other suggestions will be welcomed.
Deleted User: 
There have been hundreds of treaties discussing Bir Tawil, Antarctica, and more.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't believe that's what we would be going for though.
Deleted User: 
There is a whole organization dedicated to not claiming Bir Tawil.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I was under the impression that it would be more issues between member states or otherwise.
Not specific locations.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
My proposal for the territorial dispute treaty is that it focuses on what and what does not decree a dispute and ways to alleviate/solve it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Some sort of diplomatic treaty might be good? Something that would make it easier to formally establish relations between member states? At the moment it's very disjointed and its up to member states to establish relations with each individual member state. The treaty wouldn't tie every member into recognising every other member, and would be optional.
Deleted User: 
I don’t think any member states, or observer states for that matter, have any territorial disputes. It’s even one of the requirements to get in the alliance!
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's not about whether member states currently have disputes, it's about the future or the inevitable case when it might happen.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That doesn't mean issues can't arise in the future or with member states dealing with non-member states.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Ah, ok.
I shall be inactive for a period of time.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I still propose that we do a territorial disputes one, there isn't many ways to deal with disputes and it may be a good strong initiative to undertake to show what we as an organization can set up and do.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't believe that there are any territorial dispute treaties either.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
None that I can think of. Most disputes become squabbles of people trying to win favor of the most influential nations, rather than productive and intuitive solutions.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This is a perfect example of a recent/ongoing territorial dispute. <a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Vancouver_Island_territorial_dispute">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Vancouver_Island_territorial_dispute</a>
Vancouver Island territorial dispute</div>
The Vancouver Island territorial dispute is a currently ongoing territorial dispute that began on 29 April 2021. It has mainly been disputed between the Dominion of West Canada, the Greater Cascadian Republic, the Nexan Republic, and the Dominion of Vancouver Island.</div>
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
A diplomatic treaty may be nice, but that could be done anytime, for the 100th session I believe what we put on the table should have real weight.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that we should subsequently go with a dispute tretay.
<div class="quote">A diplomatic treaty may be nice, but that could be done anytime, for the 100th session I believe what we put on the table should have real weight.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The LIN has an org-wide treaty like this and it has proven very beneficial.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We want this session to really count. When is it to be held?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe the original day was the 25th, but with a few sessions being pushed back I am not sure if that is going to change.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">We want this session to really count. When is it to be held?
If we wish to achieve this goal then we will need to assign interested delegates towards planning each part of the session.
That way we can split the work and make it overall more efficient.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I see no reason why we cannot do that anyways.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Look. I think 25th is a good date to have an agenda done, and the session to be held the week after.
3rd or 4th of July, or somthing.
Wait.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I could see a good argument to delaying it slightly, especially since just today we were discussing new ideas of what to do.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
US Independence day
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
These are fair points actually.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes that may make conflict with celebrations.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am very divided if I'd be able to attend the summit if scheduled in any weekend in July.
I think not scheduling sessions on macronational national days may be a good idea but this should apply to all nations from where we've members.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If we host it on 2 July then it'll give us an extra week whilst also allowing me to focus on my exams.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, that sounds good.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Hosting it on 4 July creates lots of issues as it's a Sunday for starters.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
If there's not a session on 4th July for US I'day; there should not be any session on 15th August (Sunday)
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Just to quickly check, are all delegates in support of pushing back the summit to 2 July?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Aye
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would support that.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That's a Friday; could work.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Aye.
Mats - Belgica: 
Aye
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Aye.
Deleted User: 
Aye.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe it would be best to move the summit back to the 2nd of July, then.
Until then, we should focus on compiling an agenda by... next Monday?
Deleted User: 
Aye.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That sounds good.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Are the planned awards to be done on that event?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
DSD and SD could collaborate on awards, perhaps?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Aye.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
, we should compile topics of discussion during the next week.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would be glad to.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
A google doc with the agenda for it should be created. I'll see if I can get around to that.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, message me after the session and we'll discuss. I'll probably invite key SD members and DSD to a group chat.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright; that'd be wise.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
So, had we decided on doing a territorial dispute treaty then?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm not sure, but more details can be determined over the coming week.
Is there anything else pertaining to the summit, or any other topics of discussion that anyone would like to bring to the floor?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Are we inviting guests?
I would suggest inviting representatives from other organizations.
Jack Dean, etc.
Sander I - Revalia: 
That is a good idea
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
If there is nothing else, I believe that this session should conclude in ten minutes.
Thank you all for your attendance.

The floor is open to discussion.
Additionally, it would be beneficial for the summit if we had people to speak and give presentations during the summit, if you would like to participate in such please fill out this form: <a href="https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehimkVJVWAIPan4zQ4ALJAxCZhI0niMAJL-Yu9RPT-zR78Kg/viewform">https://docs.google.com/forms/d/e/1FAIpQLSehimkVJVWAIPan4zQ4ALJAxCZhI0niMAJL-Yu9RPT-zR78Kg/viewform</a>

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is intermittently present.
Asher Young - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
will further explain, so Mr. Ross would you mind explaining the treaty we have to plan this session?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Hold on I shall find what I said from earlier.
- essentially the plan is to create an international treaty which will be signed during the event.
During the last session we mostly settled on adopting a territorial dispute treaty as there is already the Sough2020 treaty for the former theme.
Any further ideas for the contents of the treaty will be helpful.
I cede.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Does anyone have any thoughts on these proposed ideas?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I strongly support the territorial dispute treaty idea. I've seen similar treaties prove very beneficial.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur.
It would be good to have some consensus on that so we can get to work with contents and make it as best of a treaty as it can be.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
Australis is present
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I personally believe that a treaty on territorial disputes would be more beneficial to the CA and the micronational community as a whole since we already have our environmental treaties and additionally micronations themselves do not have much power to make significant changes to the environment.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Indeed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Next we need to decide items on the treaty.
We could adopt something similar to the UN Treaty on the Sea but more oriented towards land disputes over the ocean: <a href="https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf">https://www.un.org/depts/los/convention_agreements/texts/unclos/unclos_e.pdf</a>
However it would be very interesting to touch on extensions to claims over bodies of waters in the form of territorial waters.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Shall now be taking over the position as the session host.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Or we could touch on international waters if there are numerous nations with overlapping territorial water claims.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hey everyone, sorry that I was out.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I agree.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It could simply be an opt-in mutual recognition treaty. All signatory nations agree to recognize each others claims.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As I will be starting to lay out the framework this evening any other suggestions would be helpful.
<div class="quote">It could simply be an opt-in mutual recognition treaty. All signatory nations agree to recognize each others claims.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That would still leave room for issues relating to ceremonial claims and claims made to intentionally be close to or hostile to other claims.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We could perhaps de-facto recognise it as an organisation however we couldn't enforce it.
<div class="quote">That would still leave room for issues relating to ceremonial claims and claims made to intentionally be close to or hostile to other claims.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I think it should be more than just we all recognise each other preferably it should lay out the process of solving land disputes as well as what may be considered fair and reasonable in context.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I think it should be more than just we all recognise each other preferably it should lay out the process of solving land disputes as well as what may be considered fair and reasonable in context.

That sounds more like a policy document than a treaty.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
So far for items for the treaty we have:
as well for easier access.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That just sounds like CA legislation. What makes it a treaty? Treaty implies an agreement between nations.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hmm.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Signing nations would agree to work with the methods provided to solve disputes, and agree to what warrants claims, hostile claims, and otherwise.
We could also have a part where nations signing the treaty will not recognizing intentional hostiles claims, and such.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Signing nations would agree to work with the methods provided to solve disputes, and agree to what warrants claims, hostile claims, and otherwise.
I think that what also make this different from CA legislation will the fact that it will be open to non-CA members for subsequent ratification unless delegates object to this.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Indeed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, less of a policy no doubt.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
opening to all would be the best option in my belief.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It will be I believe.

My favourite part.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
For our only candidate we have the Republic of Floriland
Floriland</div>
the Republic of Floriland, more commonly known as simply Floriland, is a sovereign state, called a micronation by external observers, consisting of multiple non-contiguous pieces of land.</div>

Oskonia is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
There are no remarks.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I do support admitting Floriland as observers.
Deleted User: 
Also, I apologize to my fellow delegate from Oskonia, but I will have to oppose this applicant.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Forgive me if I am speaking out of place, but, as the President of Floriland, I can answer any questions about our natiom.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
They are fairly young
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hmm.
Abstain from me.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Indeed
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I was just about to post that.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
After noticing what was talked about last session.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If they are supporting Almendria then it's a definite no from me.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
We are not,  I can confirm this.
Sander I - Revalia: 
What is this then
Fake?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's not the nation as a collective that's the problem, it's the representative.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No.
The minister has some problems basically.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I understand.
Deleted User: 
John Lakes is an… interesting person.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Indeed.
Very.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I personally support allowing Florilands to become Observers.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I also support this motion.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Does anyone wish to add anything else before we close out?
Sander I - Revalia: 
I would suggest reviewing your ministerial cabinet.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright.
Thank you everyone for attending this session, it was very productive to say the least.
Be on the watch for more sessions, and chat in a different channel than this.

Alright we should have enough delegates to begin.
Welcome and thank you to everyone for attending this evening's session.
This session will mostly be the same as the previous session, as we get closer towards the upcoming summit.
Unfortunately the summit will no longer be classed as the 100th session for obvious reasons, however we will still take the time to celebrate our 100th session during the event.
If you haven't seen the agenda already then you may find it here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5cHZ5mIO3mVIs21jw2F1MawJ6TLpPcGOorA9-Clm44/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1-5cHZ5mIO3mVIs21jw2F1MawJ6TLpPcGOorA9-Clm44/edit?usp=sharing</a>

I take full responsibility for the lack of remarks for this session.
Unless anybody wishes to add anything we shall begin.
First we'll start with the treaty.
I am pleased to report that decent headway has been made on the treaty, mainly courtesy of Carson and Lord Lewis, and the treaty has been named Berard-Malloy Convention on Territorial Disputes.
You may find the treaty here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fclrBFqwNPgtjcDakAB-RI-AI49ijko5uizB_U9vgNE/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fclrBFqwNPgtjcDakAB-RI-AI49ijko5uizB_U9vgNE/edit</a>

So far we've covered Articles I and II out of the total 7 currently planned.
We were also discussing Article IV last night if I recall correctly.
As this is the best time to work on the treaty, we will be discussing Articles IV and hopefully VII if we have time this session.
Article IV - Defining hostile claims (Puppet governments for the intention of annexation?)
The floor is now open to discussion.
We'll begin with Article IV, which we'll first define what a hostile claim is exactly.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" style="color: rgb(94, 197, 171); background-color: rgba(94, 197, 171, 0.1);">@Members</span>
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Pinelandia is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Hostile claim = A claim which has deliberately been established next to a sovereign state with the sole purpose of creating friction between two or more governments. This may be with the intention of annexation or creating a conflict.
Any suggestions would be helpful.
If we don't have any activity within the next few minutes I will be postponing this session to a later date.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe it would be worth including something about independent nations being set up in place of a nation claiming directly.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Apologies, but an outstanding personal emergency appeared just after the session time started. Atiera is no longer present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
<div class="quote">I believe it would be worth including something about independent nations being set up in place of a nation claiming directly.
Hostile claim = A claim which has deliberately been established next to a sovereign state with the sole purpose of creating friction between two or more governments. This may be with the intention of annexation or creating a conflict. Additionally, puppet states may be established by an individual or collective in order to pursuit a similar goal.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
With that addition I suppose we would also have to address identifying such states, but that may have to come in a different section as I can already guess some will get creative about hiding such states.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Perhaps the definition could be amended to say A claim that deliberately creates friction between two or more governments. This may be with the intention of annexation or creating a conflict. My reasoning for this change is that some claims are established without realizing another party claims the land in question. After this is discovered by both parties, one party may weaponize their claims to maintain a presence in the area.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That is true, and I'll add it now.
<div class="quote">With that addition I suppose we would also have to address identifying such states, but that may have to come in a different section as I can already guess some will get creative about hiding such states.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia will be sporadically present.

Anybody wish to add anything further to this statement?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I agree.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I have no other suggestions at this time.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright, I shall add it to the treaty now.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
None from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Would it be worth discussing Article VII during this session or instead leaving it until a later date?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We could, but there is a bit of a low attendance today.
Atleast, an attendance discussing the treaty.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think that we'll leave it until later; if we have a higher attendance later on then we'll revisit the subject.
Next up we'll move onto the formal planning for the summit.
The current timetable continues to stand:
I think that we should discuss the session which shall be hosted during the event.
That includes the agenda.
As always I will be handing the creation of the agenda.
The floor is open to suggestions regarding ideas for the session.
Because of the number of applicants we've had this week, I'm thinking of hosting a symbolic 4th reading of the applicants.
Of course the voting period will not be affected by this.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe I heard it mentioned that we would have external visitors during the session, would they be present the whole time?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That sounds like an interesting idea.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I believe I heard it mentioned that we would have external visitors during the session, would they be present the whole time?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
So would they be able to participate during the brief session or just to observe?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">So would they be able to participate during the brief session or just to observe?
Similar to our current open session hall system.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Alright I see, I was just curious as that may have affected what we include in the agenda.
Obviously though, it won't. So thank you for the clarification.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Due to the lack of activity, I have taken the executive decision to postpone this session until a later time.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I can't think of any other big events coming up unless we wanted to include a discussion about the upcoming election.

would be doing this in the next session probably
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes that is true.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We need a fixed and stable voting system and I believe it'd be wise if all three campaigns come together for this noble cause.

James B. - Desert District: 
I do support delegate voting for most things, but nation voting for Chair elections.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with Mr. Bornstein.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Nation voting for every thing is good.
James B. - Desert District: 
We tried it, it didn’t work.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We will see to that; but for now, the chair election is the first priority
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It prevents the practice of vote stuffing in elections - Something that there was a very real risk of during the last campaign season.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
We tried it once in only one way, we should find a new way to make it work.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I've talked about electoral reform before - and I'll say it again - We need to put more stable electoral systems into place before the upcoming election.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The GUM tried a new system just before the election and it really went good.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
At the very least, a bill should be proposed to hold the vote for the election in a secure form. If we need more time to fully develop a system that fits every type of vote, we can take that time but the election is a priority.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
But I don't think it should be put into place by the candidates themselves, which is why I abstained from doing so.
Mats - Belgica: 
Belgica is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does not matter; we are simply stopping vote stuffing and it's a good sign if candidates do.
Tyler proposing it would give a good message.
We are not promoting corruption but rather helping it stop.
Anyways, if no other members have anything else to add.

The 101st session is a American Session scheduled to be hosted on 27 June 202...</div>
We have a bit to get to, so lets start.
So first we have to discuss the planning of the Digital Summit.
Do you want to speak on this?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The digital summit is currently planned for next Friday, unfortunately we have missed the window for the 100th session however.
Currently the timetable will be:
Out of this, the treaty signing, opening and games have been covered.
I feel like we should fix a certain time slot for the presentations and finalise what games will be available during the post-event period.
I cede.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
So games are going to be Jackbox right?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We have a variety of games planned but Jackbox will be one of them.
My proposals as you may know are Jackbox, Gartic, skribbl.io (and maybe) roblox if people are really up for it.
Any other suggestions will be welcomed.
Deleted User: 
Jackbox Party Packs? My favorite!
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Roblox… I…
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I agree with most of those except roblox. I think you shouldn’t have to create a account if you don’t have one.
Deleted User: 
They removed the guest feature a while back.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I mean it takes 30 seconds to create an account.
Not even that.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Also it would be kinda awkward to try to find a game with like 20 slots and friend eachother.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
True
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Some people don’t want to create a account however.
Deleted User: 
Does one of us have the robux to do the VIP servers?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Some people don’t want to create a account however.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I have 1.3k.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
People still play Roblox?
Deleted User: 
That's... an awful lot.
Deleted User: 
Sometimes.
Mostly I play Framed or Natural Disaster Survival.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Off topic but it’s buying and reselling limiteds.
Deleted User: 
Ooh we got ourselves a gambler!
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
But if we are going to do roblox we need to find a game.
Deleted User: 
Ahh I've got one

Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Anyeeee or something along the lines like that.
Deleted User: 
Your stubbornness.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
However I believe that this would be better discussed outside of the session.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright we are starting to get off topic.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I will DM you the answer.
Deleted User: 
True.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Talk about it after the session.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Fair enough
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
So now about the time slots.
It depends on how much presentations we have.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
Yes, too many people are immature :/
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I haven't received any requests for presentation slots yet, however I will be starting to advertise it outside of the server later.
<div class="quote">Yes, too many people are immature :/
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think if we have for example 10 presentations, we allot 2-3 minutes where as if we get 3-5 we allot 5 minutes.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
That’s reasonable
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It’s worrying that we don’t have any presentations, but maybe as time comes up we get more.
Deleted User: 
When is the event occuring?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Hopefully we will receive some presentations soon.
<div class="quote">When is the event occuring?
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
May our delegation also request an upgrade to full membership, so we may become more active and participate in programs?
Deleted User: 
Wow, that's soon.
Deleted User: 
You will get another full member vote. The first vote you were rejected as members.
President Wyatt Baek - Gapla: 
I see
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah basically we vote on it every 2 weeks I believe.
Does anyone wish to add anything more before we move on?
Deleted User: 
Doesn't that also mean Oskonia's vote for full membership is also today?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's currently up for vote.
However we are straying off topic again.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes if anyone isn’t adding anything we are moving on.
Next we have the Berard-Malloy treaty.
The convention for such treaty is listed here.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fclrBFqwNPgtjcDakAB-RI-AI49ijko5uizB_U9vgNE/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fclrBFqwNPgtjcDakAB-RI-AI49ijko5uizB_U9vgNE/edit</a>

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We have made a decent dent in the final treaty, as we have already covered 3 articles.
I subsequently feel as if we would be good to discuss another article during this session.
Article V - Defining territorial disputes
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I believe the base definition of territorial disputes are when 2 nations use land knowingly without the consent of the other user.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Territorial dispute: a disagreement over the control of a particular territory between two or more sovereign states, typically without the consent of the other state.
How does this sound?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think it sounds great.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Want to add anything?
Deleted User: 
I think it sounds wonderful.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I shall add it now then.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
That sounds good.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I feel like we should expand on it though.
Otherwise it seems a bit short and out of place to me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
How so?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Compared to the other articles it seems rather short.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I also feel like we should add sub articles of sorts, perhaps defining more clearly what is and isn't classed as a territorial dispute.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I'm not entirely sure what else we could add to the definition that wouldn't just serve as additional clarification.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
True.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, i’m trying to think of something to make it longer.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Maybe we should define territorial conflicts and reiterate the fact that they're different things?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah. Like a separation from a claim dispute.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A territorial dispute is different from a territorial conflict in which the latter typically involves a state of conflict between two or more belligerents over the status of a territory, typically succeeding a territorial dispute. Territorial disputes are typically resolved via peaceful diplomatic means.
How about that?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That sounds good.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
So a conflict is just that there is more parties involved?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A conflict is just a dispute where it results in a war.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Would that cause them to only be defined post a war beginning?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
A conflict does not necessarily imply a war.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, it doesn’t always end at war so you describe it when a war starts.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I guess I am not sure if there is a good reason to define disputes and conflicts differently, would it affect anything in the solving of such issues?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe we should merely address disputes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That is true.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
So we agree on the original sentence?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Can do.
Deleted User: 
Can we revive this session, please?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What do you mean?
Deleted User: 
No activity in 2 minutes is bad.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Waiting to see if we should do 1 more Article, sorry.
Well.
Let’s move on then.
Now we have the Third reading of Amendment XI
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jYmPSz41U0Or5PJeAu12z1JXuo7LjfVM3_UA_bcr3yw/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1jYmPSz41U0Or5PJeAu12z1JXuo7LjfVM3_UA_bcr3yw/edit</a>

We completely forgot about this amendment somehow from May.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I was about to say, this is the third reading and I hadn't seen it before.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Somehow we managed to completely forget about this for 1 month.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Basically it makes the rule on 3 observers max clearer.
I am in full support of this.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes, it seems like a simple and needed fix.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
I'm in support of this bill.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Does anyone wish to add anything before we move on?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Nothing here.
Deleted User: 
Nothing from Oskonia.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright moving on.
Next we have to discuss the Inactive members purge.
I would mainly point the finger at Huai Siao, but they just got a new delegate so we should give them some time to see if they get any more active.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I suppose so.
Who else is overtly inactive?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Plushunia maybe.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I shall obtain the list.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Last session attended was at the start of May.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Do we have a master sheet to track session attendance?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<span class="mention" style="">@deleted-role</span> <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(26, 188, 156); background-color: rgba(26, 188, 156, 0.1);">@Huai Siao</span> <span class="mention" style="">@deleted-role</span> <span class="mention" style="">@deleted-role</span>
Scoria hasn't attended a session since December, however have apparently been on leave due to health issues.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Appoint a new delegate then.
I don’t think the problem of health problems should affect if they appoint someone else.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What about the others? Are their nations inactive or are they just inactive here?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Cristi is currently going through exams as far as I'm aware.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Iceni never went to any sessions.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I haven't heard anything from Hausgurd or Iceni.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
How are they a member?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm not sure.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This calls for a executive kick or something.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would have to agree.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
In their defence I believe that their primary delegate is undergoing military training.
However by this point it's gotten ridiculous.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well, the point still stands to get someone else.
It’s funny at this point.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
I will support the expulsion of Scoria, Iceni and perhaps Hausgurd.
I'll abstain on Huai Siao and Plushunia.
Primarily the former to see how they perform over the next week with their new delegate.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hausgurd hasn’t shown to a session for 6 months.
2 delegates by the way.
Deleted User: 
<div class="quote">I will support the expulsion of Scoria, Iceni and perhaps Hausgurd.
I agree with both.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Does anyone wish to add anything before moving on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Deleted User: 
Nothing over here.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Moving on.
Next we have “Nation-only voting for elections (Tyler Mullins)”
I don’t actually know what this is.
Are you able to go in detail?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As this is not my proposal I don't believe I can.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe it relates to the amendment that was in the past to make voting on a nation basis rather than a delegate basis.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Tyler isn’t online.
Deleted User: 
can explain? He's online.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This is what I received from Tyler on the subject:
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think they want to make it so that each nation gets one vote for the next election, rather than each delegate
It was brought up last session I believe.
Deleted User: 
Oh.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
There is a upside and a downside to that.
Deleted User: 
I would support it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Upside is nations with 3 delegates can’t control over nations with 1.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
For now I’ll abstain on it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'll probably support the motion.
Deleted User: 
True, I change to abstain.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Why is that viewed as a negative thing that makes you change to abstain?
I would feel that would be a clear positive.
Deleted User: 
Minority over majority.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Downside is nations are going to either have to appoint a main voter and others don’t vote or nations host their own meetings on who to vote for.
Deleted User: 
Each delegate deserves a voice.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I’m probably opposing.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
But that would just lead to vote stacking.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I feel like it would be better for nations to choose how to vote on a broader scale than have their delegates pick for them.
Can't be too much communication there if delegates are choosing independently.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I see no reason why delegates can't decide between each other and then vote.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Does anyone wish to add anything else before we do membership time?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Something that could work is a nation voting then that being put into a single vote, somewhat like an electoral college.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
For major things, like chair elections, I feel like it would be better to have it be on a nation by nation basis. That way people can't bring in delegates to vote just for the election.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Is that possible with the voting bot?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That seems needlessly bueaucratic if we could just encourage delegates to communicate on their vote before hand.
Deleted User: 
I will be abstaining.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Abstain.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
It could be possible, however I feel a better option would be goggle forms.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would be in full support of this. It's our duty to plug gaps that could allow corruption in.
I can't see any other way to prevent vote stacking than just have nations vote as a whole.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Ok, now does anyone wish to add anything else.
Before we move on.
Deleted User: 
No.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I personally do not.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Membership time!

Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Is Shiro still in charge of Stormhold?
I haven't had the best relations with them.
But I think they would be good as an Observer State as long as they are represented by someone like Lord Lewis.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
With Shiro I mean.

Huai Siao just set a new delegate. Let’s give them a chance for atleast 1-2 more weeks.
Plushunia could appoint another delegate.
Thfff-orin.
Probably a abstain for Huai Siao because they’ve had so many chances.

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As far as I am aware, Chair and regional ministers are only speakers of quorum and hence can summon or close a quorum.

Noted. We shall commence the session with an appropriate presence at this time.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville:

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Speaker, may I address a topic following this bills reading?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I am in full support of this act.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am also in full support of this act.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Will you be able to wait until the end of the legislation/discussion time, before membership attainment time?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania supports this act.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That would depend on how long this takes. I will be unavailable five minutes to the hour.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Would you like to inform me of your request and I can propose it for you at the appropriate time?
If that is of course permitted.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
In DMs.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is present.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
HUAI SIAO is present
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That said, I am partially in support of this act. My only gripe is that it applies only to elections, and not to the alliance as a whole.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I am in full support of the Fair Voting Act. It is the type of electoral reform that is sorely needed within the Alliance, as least as a temporary measure for the election.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
As election, do you mean Chair and Lieutenant Chair, or Voting in General?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Probably the former.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Chair elections.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The upcoming chairmanship election.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The former, though I would love for it to be the latter ideally.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The Chair elect or upcoming administration may look to implement it as a whole to the voting system irrespective of elections or general voting.
We must at all times have a one-nation one-vote system.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Aye, absolutely.
It is rather.. baffling why this is no longer the case here.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The act does give the Chair power to uphold nation voting for a specific act, so it can be used occasionally, unless another act extends it to all voting in the Alliance, which you prefer.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Regardless, this act does not pertain to national voting across the whole organisation - Just elections.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
A shame.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We could amend it with time.
But for now, the focus is on elections
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If a delegate wishes to change this, create an act to do so. Otherwise, please keep discussion relevant to the current topic.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Once we have found a better solution we can probably extend it to all matters to be voted on.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Exactly, we would look to that in the future but for now our concern in regarding the elections scheduled next month.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I mean if people can provide a decent solution and bill for one nation voting in time for the next session then feel free.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I think the point we are trying to say is the act <strong>should</strong> be applied to all forms of voting across the Organisation.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur, but please focus on what the act currently is proposing.
Do any delegates/member states have further questions or comments regarding the Fair Voting Act?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
None.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from me
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing more from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, moving on then. Next up we have an issue that has been plaguing several member states of the Cupertino Alliance - inactivity. The following member states are looking at expulsion votes if they don't show necessary activity, as membership in the CA is an ongoing commitment as opposed to a one-time thing. 
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr Speaker?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I wish to let the delegates of the Cupertino Alliance know that Huai Siao, however, is present at the current session.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Mr. Valentinus, go ahead.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Support:
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
These nations have been warned several times. I believe it is time to take action. I believe expulsion votes should commence immediately after the session.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That is not true.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
This is true, Sir.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="Isaiah.B#2583">@Isaiah Burdette - Burdette</span>
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Oh my bad.
They just haven't said anything
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">These nations have been warned several times. I believe it is time to take action. I believe expulsion votes should commence immediately after the session.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Although I must say that they have just confirmed their presence and done nothing else, as I warned against at the beginning of this session.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This is the 3rd reading.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd oppose the expulsion of Huai Siao from the alliance, while support the expulsion of the other nations including Plushunia.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Cristi is currently unavailable due to exams I believe.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
He has not given any notice.
He can't make clouds of thoughts.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Well, 
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The President of Scoria is on break for health issues, then that must be considered if we're considering Cristi's exams when which is not confirmed.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Huai Siao is one of the worst offenders on this list - I understand that you invited them to the CA, Mr. Roy, but prior to today they have not attended a session since November 2020. Even then, their new, Active delegate has done not a single thing except for confirming their presence in this session.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I never said that.
I said Joseph is.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
In addition, Wegmat is too inactive.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Joseph being the one who has gone missing.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
5 months is already a ridiculous amount of time.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
John Gordon is, from what I've heard in Austenasia, serving in the British military I believe, and is probably the reason why he is not present most of the time.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
God save the Queen!
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">The President of Scoria is on break for health issues, then that must be considered if we're considering Cristi's exams when which is not confirmed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
If we're considering Cristi's exams, then we must consider Mr. Grainger's illness and Gordan's service to his nation's military.
Plushunia to my knowledge has not contributed to the alliance ever since joining the alliance with us in March.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Exams are temporary - Extended illness and military service are for extended period of time, so this must be considered.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
So, he is having exams for some months now? From March if I am not wrong?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I am unsure.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The argument of they could assign another delegate applies to many of these cases.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
HUAI SIAO will be active please don't expelled us
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Please show an active commitment in these sessions then, Mr. Hazarika.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
the HUC doesn't have one other then myself, in which I am already occupied.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This is literally your last chance - You need to show the organisation everything you've got to stand a chance in the expulsion vote.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will likely support the expulsion of Huai Siao, if the new delegate does not show active commitment. If otherwise then I will oppose.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Likewise.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I’m sorry but I don’t understand, and this is for many of the nations mentioned, why the CA should give months of slack in the hopes that something gets better.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It is the delegate's first session, I would encourage that we give him some time to adjust.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Active presence in a session doesn't require adjusting.
A tough stance needs to be taken against inactivity.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I mean, the governments of these nations can’t assign another delegate? Are they inactive too? If they don’t have more people why weren’t they looking for someone well aware of the issue?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Far tougher than as it is currently.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
He still needs to know how things function here, Mr. Hamilton.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
I will show the activeness please don't expelled us
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You'd better tell him, then.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That said, this is the final reading of a motion that has been in the works for several months, originating from ministerial orders from the Asian Ministry.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
HUC has a perfectly fine Government.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
You too can, thank you.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I’m not accusing that it doesn’t, but I must ask why it hasn’t addressed the issue here then.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
I support  today's agenda
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Can you not appoint one of these government members as a delegate then?
Muchnieg I - Hausgurd: 
Hello sorry for me not bieng online for basically all time
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Can we proceed?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur. Do any delegates have any further questions or comments pertaining to this topic?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
None from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We had Hausgurd and Huai Siao appearing in this session, I'd suggest we postpone their expulsion.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I fiercely oppose this motion.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I feel like the CA has to stop giving so must slack, we wait for months and then they show up last minute and we give them another chance.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Thanks
I will show my activeness
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I mean the HUC just had meaningful questions asked of it and the one person arguing for them wants to move on.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I disagree. We should let it go ahead, and allow them to give their argument against expulsion outside of a session.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I encourage the Cupertino Alliance to cut the talk, and finally take some long-awaited action.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Hear hear!
Rory - Lurdentania: 
that was because no one had spoken in period of time.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Its beyond a joke now.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
If we're expelling all nations, we must expel Plushunia as well.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Could you respond to our concerns then?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe they are being included in the expulsion vote, yes.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
If the nations government doesn’t care about its commitment here, why should we.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's why an expulsion vote is going up for all the nations mentioned, Mr. Roy.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What were your concerns and why am I expected to answer on behalg of a nation I dont formally represent?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am not aware of other nations, Huai Siao appointed their new delegate last week.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
There's mentioned oppose: Plushunia
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
You have been arguing on behalf of their government and them staying.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's still going up regardless.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does the agenda say oppose or the Minister says oppose?
And what about Wegmat?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
may I trust you to deliver my discussion regarding session timings during this session?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe this has turned into a heated argument, I ask that all delegates calm down, and I ask that we proceed with the agenda.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You can trust me to deliver it.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
if you wish to continue discussing it.
Next on our agenda is the Post-summit recap. As I understand, last nights digital summit was a huge success, despite a few hiccups, such as Mr. Roy's PowerPoint, and timing issues.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Why can I know the  reason
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I must say, the timing balls-up needs to be avoided in future.. two emergency time changes led to plans being messed up, and affecting a few of our delegates and speakers.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Did West Sayville not depart for the session?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Honestly, after the delays, I was surprised by the turnout.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I have a question, 
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I do concur that from the next time we have a fixed timing and then we stick to that.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would have to assume discussion on the summit and about what we could do and should do for a future one.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's merely a discussion on it's success, and some things we can do better for next time.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Ah ok thank you.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Ok
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Does anybody have anything they'd like to say about the summit? Things you'd like to see happen next time?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I have to also say the session conducted over voice had some odd results. There was much more discussion on applicants, but it also resulted in a lot of cross talk.
It was like actually saying it out loud made people more invested in figuring out everything about a nation.
It’s not reasonable to do every session like that, but it was interesting.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Next time, can we not have people creating there presentations during the summit, causing delays with presentations? Like We waited for Tucker Gladden's presentatioin for around a total of 15 minutes all up.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Aye, we should probably have checks to make sure they are ready or have them removed from the agenda.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Perhaps
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Having these summits quarterly or twice a year would be beneficial to the Alliance.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Sounds interesting!
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
What about a Hoi4 game.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Sure
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
To minimise crosstalk, we could have a text channel where delegates ask to have the floor, then they are given permission to unmute?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We could use the stage channel for that exact purpose. The only reason we didn’t use it I believe was because it didn’t allow screen share.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Or they could use a software with a Raise your hand setting to somewhat ask for the floor.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Honestly, the including of games led to some delegates getting off topic near the end. They started rushing through the territorial disputes treaty because they wanted to “play jackbox”.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah. An odd lack of the feature from Discord, but out of our control, unfortunately.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra will be intermittently absent.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted, Mr. Roy.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I am not sure how many actually looked at the treaty in detail, and instead just wanted to get to the games.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don’t oppose having an informal period at the end, we just need to ensure the focus is on the session until then.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm incredibly sorry to hear that - I understand a LOT of effort was put into it by mostly you, and for that you should be incredibly proud of yourself.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I appreciate that, both me and Logan were happy with what we put out, and we hope to keep expanding the presence of the treaty even after the summit.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Yes I agree with you
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania will be briefly not present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Noted.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That is all I can think of comment wise for the summit at the moment.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Right, are there any other questions or comments about the summit last night then?
Congratulations to all those who presented in it, by the way.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
They were all of good quality, it was impressive.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Right then. Moving on, I'll be presenting something on behalf of Sertor Valentinus.
Mr. Valentinus wishes to state that he is disappointed in the lack of session optimization polls that we so commonly used to see in previous administrations. In order to maximise session attendance, he, and also I, believe that this should be put into place once again.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What do you mean?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It was a Google Form where you could select the times you could attend a session.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I was not present under the previous administration, but if it was a system that worked in the past I wouldn't oppose it's return.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It should certainly resume.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Mats - Belgica: 
I agree
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I apologize, I can't provide much more commentary to this.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur with Mr. Hamilton.
Mats - Belgica: 
Belgica will no longer be present
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I guess slightly relating to this do we, as an alliance, track session attendance? Possibly to see who is most affected by the lack of this program.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
We already do this I believe.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We don't actively do so currently.
We check occasionally if a member hasn't attended, but we don't have a system to check all nations.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I see, it may be something worth doing with the issues of inactivity and to get a visual of when nations can regularly attend. A google sheets document could easily just have us fill in a box for each session so that we can easily look at attendance and when.
Each minister could just be given editing access and just mark down presence at the beginning of the session they are hosting.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think that is a great idea.

Vishwamitra is present
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Hello everyone it is my first session on CA session hall I am very happy to attend this we have a good discussion most of the members are active.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Seeing as we've had a good discussion pertaining to this topic, shall we move onto membership applications?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe so.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Good to see this
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Please proceed, Mr. Hamilton.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
First up, we have the Heroanian Empire.
Heroanian Empire
This isn't a great application - An invalid invite and a very small introduction.
It'll be a pass from me, I think.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd be abstain it.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
It's a No from me.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
A hard no from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, I suppose we should move on then, considering a lack of information to go off.
Next is the United Sea Bass Islands.
United Sea Bass Islands
United Sea Bass Islands</div>
The United Sea Bass Islands, or Sea Bass for short, is a sovereign micronation formed and founded on 30 June 2019. It has a democratic form of government, and currently has diplomatic ties with several other micronations.

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra:

Worth discussing them
Hard no
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Where could we find this out?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville will be briefly present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
A minute please.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
This is from GUM.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Ah, from GUM.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe this should be taken into concern?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
A hard no to the application of the United Sea Bass Islands.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes - I won't put this application up at the end of the session, I'll wait for Ross to executively reject them.
Considering they're inelegible, let's move on.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I did point this last week but the Chair did not say a word.
He could executively reject them then
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next up is Snagov, a former member of the CA. I encourage that we allow their entrance to the CA.
Snagovian Federation
Snagovian Federation</div>
The Snagovian Federal Republic, also known as the Snagovian FR, or just Snagov, is a self-declared independent state with little or no international recognition,  and is commonly referred to as micronation by external observers.

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Hard yes from me.
Deleted User: 
Oskonia is present
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Great friends of Vishwamitra
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
A strong Yes. I have interacted before with them and they are very professional.
Deleted User: 
I would also say yes to this micronation.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Isn’t it against GUM rules to leak member channels?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Is this from a public channel or not? I've committed the same mistake here, and just wanted to make sure it is from a public one
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think that membership rejections are still published in GUM Lobby to the public, anyway.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, those are published on lobby
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Oh ok.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
And it is not a secret information I am passing, something that Mr. Valentinus did months back.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Oh looks like it wasn't published in the Lobby this time.
That's from a members only channel in the GUM, at this time.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There’s no need for sniping here. Please maintain decorum and a gentlemanly conduct.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur - I demand for this to cease, and for us to get back onto the topic at hand.
Take argumentative behaviour to DMs.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur. I ask Mr. Roy to cease his behavior.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let's move on.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Please avoid the use of whataboutism.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next up is the Kingdom of Pibocip.

Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
What's the website about
Seems to be a gallery about micronational people
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
A strong yes. They are great allies of Vishwamitra as well, and seem very professional.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I hardly support their application; would  be great part.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Could be about their leader?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, calling them greatest would really be good actually
Deleted User: 
I also support them being let in.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Yes
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I support their entrance.
If we have nothing else to discuss, let's move on to the next nation.
The Kingdom of Elava
Kingdom of Elava</div>
Elava, formally known as the The Kingdom of Elava, is a self-declared independent nation-state, referred to as a micronation. It is located in the south of Sweden in the county of Sk&#229;ne. It was founded on the 20th of October 2020 with the signing of its Ex Codice Elava (its founding document).</div>
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I support their application.
Would be good part.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
They seem professional.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Yes
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Seems good, I'll support.
Deleted User: 
I will also support them.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
I will support them
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Allow us to move on now that we have received feedback on this application.
Our second last topic for tonight belongs to the Republic of Kranoya.
The Republic of Kranoya
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Seems good, I'd support their application.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
They have a microwiki page, as a note, which was found yesterday during the summit.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Ah, thank you for letting me know.
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Republic_of_Kranoya">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Republic_of_Kranoya</a>

Even still, not very developed.
It'll be an abstain from me.
Considering we have very little activity now, we'll move onto the final topic of tonight.
Imperial Principality of Stormhold

Stormhold, officially the Imperial Principality of Stormhold, is a non-territorial micronation loosely based around the MicroWiki sector. (Note that this entity should NOT be confused or associated with others of the same name.)

I strongly recommend that  this nation be admitted to the CA. They've shown exceptional professionalism in the GUM.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
They seem good.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I strongly support their acceptance; and just to note that their leader has been a former GUM Chair.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright. Considering most people are gone now and we've finished the agenda, we shall conclude at 12:00AM AWST (12PM EDT), AKA in 8 minutes, unless a delegate has any further proposals.
Thank you all for your attendance tonight, have a good day/evening.

As per the previous two readings, this act is intended to allow for the upcoming chairmanship election (And any subsequent votes designated) to utilise national voting, instead of delegate voting.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I am fully in support of this act for obvious reasons.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This will make voting fairer, as some nations have 3 delegates, while others have just 1, giving that nation a bigger say in CA matters.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I am in full support of this amendment as well.
Mats - Belgica: 
As am I.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Provided there are no further comments on this act, I see fit that we should move onto our next topic.
Which is a nomination for a second Associate Judge, who will impartially oversee the Chairmanship election.

and I have all determined that he would be an impartial candidate, and thus we all approve of him.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I am fully in support of nominating our former chair to the position - I do not believe that there is anyone that knows the Alliance better than Lycon, so I have my full trust that he is a reliable and unbiased delegate.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As previously stated, he also has my full support.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I am glad to see all the chair candidates being able to come together and agree on this necessity without much delay, he has my support as well.
Mats - Belgica: 
I do not have much knowledge on what his qualities are, but if many of the higher members of the Cupertino alliance say that he is qualified then I give him my support.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Jayden Lycon was the first proper Chairman of the CA. He served 2 terms (1 year).
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Lycon was also the biggest figure in the reformation and original creation of the CA.
Deleted User: 
He has my support.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Almost everything that the alliance rests on was built by him.
Mats - Belgica: 
Okay, if he has done all that then I believe he is qualified for the job.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Considering that he has unanimous support from here, I believe that we should move onto the next and final item on tonight's agenda.
The final reading for the Imperial Principality of Stormhold's membership application.

They have my full support, as outlined in the previous session.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Aye, I’ve heard nothing but positivity about this applicant.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Mats - Belgica: 
They have my support
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I would be in support with the new leadership of the nation.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If that is all we have to say on this nation's application, and no-one has any proposals not on tonight's agenda, I believe that we should adjourn this session in five minutes. This was a very short, 15 minute session as very few items were on tonight's agenda.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I believe that this is one of the shortest sessions that we have hosted.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Oh and I've only just become availabele.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe presence was impacted as a result of American Independence Day.
It's a good thing the agenda wasn't huge.

We don't have a huge amount to cover this evening, so unless anybody wishes to add anything we shall begin.
As we already have a fairly high turnout right now, I'd like to start with the membership applications because of the aforementioned number of delegates present.
Berry Kingdom
Berry Kingdom</div>
Berry Kingdom is a  sovereign micronation which has multiple territories, provinces and cities as well as rich nature.</div>
I believe that they were present at the digital summit in which they presented their software Micronear.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Australis is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd be supportive of their application; I have had very positive interactions with their leader.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their page looks fairly bare, however based on my interactions with them in the prior session I would be willing to give them a chance.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
I support their application
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I would be willing to approve of Observership.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Overall it a great one
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur with the Honourable Delegate for Saspearian.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
All nations are admitted in as observers and then promoted or rejected
There's no separate system to grant observership as in GUM.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their website seems to be a stark contrast to their Micronear website however.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That's true; I believe the nation emphasizes more on that project.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe he means that they should be admitted to the CA, and then retain observership in their promotion vote.
That's what I'd recommend, anyway.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What is Micronear?
Deleted User: 
I would be willing to give them a shot at observership.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
How long will this iteration last for then?

Will they be stable enough to maintain Observership?

Logan Ross - Aenopia:

I think it would be worth giving them a chance, and if they undergo serious instability we can always open an expulsion vote.

Unless anybody wishes to add anything further then we shall move on.
Duchy of Pontunia 
Duchy of Pontunia</div>
Pontunia, officially the Duchy of Pontchartrain-Maurepas, is an independent micronation that amicably seceded from the Austenasian Crown Dependency of New Pontunia in February 2021. It is comprised of various residential properties and two public parks declared independent from Metairie, Louisiana under the leadership of Duke Andrew I.</div>
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Absolutely no.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would like to add in regards to this application that there seems to be serious attempts to change and improve their image within the community, which I must applaud however I don't believe that enough time has passed.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
No from me.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
While I am glad to see he is starting to change I believe that more time is needed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If they reapply in a few months with constant development then I would be happy to accept them.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I concur; more time should do well for Pontunia to establish greater stability.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This nation is rather unstable, and has been involved in some appalling stuff.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Yes they need to change it more
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think that the behaviour of the representing delegate themselves, and the nation's tendency to gain and lose independence is grounds for me to oppose this application.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
In regards to Fesmar, I believe they are currently fit to join the Alliance. Perhaps offering Observership for time time being will allow the Alliance to better determine whether membership is truly appropriate.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
I oppose this application
Deleted User: 
I see potential in Pontunia as I've spoken with their leader multiple times since the events and he has tried his absolute hardest to change Pontunia for the better.
I don't see why we could at least give them 1 shot.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I don't see why we could at least give them 1 shot.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'll abstain from the application proposal.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
The Alliance may always vote at any point to revoke Observer status on Pontunia.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That is true.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Just as with Stormhold, should its recent government change prove a harbinger of instability (which, so far, has not).
Deleted User: 
I'm going to support, but I'm leaning abstain.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Probably would have inferred it already, but I am giving this application a hard oppose.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Naturally, I cannot vote due to observer status, but I do advise erring on the side of allowing observer status for Pontunia, albeit with a longer probationary period than normal.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I've spoken my piece on both applications.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None further from I.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Next we shall discuss further applications for the Fair Voting Act and ways that we can implement them successfully.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is no longer present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Although we all know that the act was presented for the upcoming elections, the groundwork is there for future development including nation-only voting for the entire Alliance.
The floor is open to suggestions and discussion.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As discussed in the prior session, I believe we should have an AYE/NAY voting channel, or open a subpage on MicroWiki which the Associate Judge may sift through and verify ballots.
This would be the simplest solution.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As has been stated, the act already allows for nation based voting on any vote.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'd prefer the first one.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The former would be more convenient.
James B. - Desert District: 
?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present for a while.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Chair.
James B. - Desert District: 
It’s quite simple.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I greatly appreciate efforts towards shifting to organization/nation voting rather than delegate voting, as it levels the playing field for smaller delegations and smaller polities in this organization. There are several competing versions, but I would endorse whatever works out the best for the Alliance in the end. In fact, such efforts are, in part, what led to Stormhold's final decision to apply to the Alliance to begin with.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
General-wise, the latter would be inconvenient.
James B. - Desert District: 
You get an account, add your name, and it’s done. Visual editor while buggy would even work for that.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Thats why the AYE/NAY channel would work best.
James B. - Desert District: 
Would there be an option for private ballots?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Simple for me, may not be for all. Also, not all delegates have an account and we can't force them to make one.
James B. - Desert District: 
I personally think it should be required to be public but I’m curious anyways.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Huai Siao is no longer present
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Could we do like a “survey monkey” type platform?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
There should be provision for such to be submitted to the AJ.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
What is that?
James B. - Desert District: 
I don’t think that’s good.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Having a channel would simply be the easiest way.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The GUM is using a new voting bot which shows what delegate voted what, and who voted.
James B. - Desert District: 
In the UN they publicly vote on nations, and I don’t see why you would be afraid of your vote being public.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Perhaps we could adopt the same bot?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur, I’m in favour of a channel.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
<a href="https://www.surveymonkey.com">https://www.surveymonkey.com</a>
SurveyMonkey: The World’s Most Popular Free Online Survey Tool</div>
Use SurveyMonkey to drive your business forward by using our free online survey tool to capture the voices and opinions of the people who matter most to you.</div>
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I think the channel is better, and will allow easier implementation in future for general votes.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
This is easily leading to confusion amongst members, as it's a fair bit harder to tell what button we hit, and when, and whether our vote is recorded. The crowded looking list isn't helping things, either.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
We use this at the university for polls that we take for faculty
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
A public version of the poll could be revealed in another channel once the voting period is over.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The pollmaster bot also has some glaring issues. Changing a vote for example is very tricky to do.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We could always release the results in announcements irrespective of what system we use.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Do we not do that already with the elections?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">A public version of the poll could be revealed in another channel once the voting period is over.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Survey Monkey is a polling website. It allows for multiple votes. Sorry... I realized I didn’t explain it much lol
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Decorum.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Well, as the delegate is proposing something unique, we'd take a look to it.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe we already have Google Forms to fill that niche.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We need to use a system which is secure from the view of an election for the two post.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unless anybody wishes to add anything further we shall move on.
Next up we have planning for the CA awards ceremony.
We have an idea of when this will be hosted, however we now need to figure out what categories shall be present during the event.
This is aside from the usual awards and the Lycon Cross.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
What are the usual awards? Might I enquire?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
The Cupertino Ribbon, delegate and citizen class.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A few months ago we proposed these awards:
Any other suggestions will be helpful.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Will subjects related to heraldry, vexillology fall under Culture?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That could probably be its own category.
Perhaps design.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That sounds good.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I don't think that Micronation of the Year should be included - I feel like it would become more of a popularity driven award as opposed to one based upon skill. Furthermore, what makes a micronation the micronation of the year? Such a classification would have many definitions amongst many people.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
True.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd concur with Mr. Hamilton. 
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I would like to assume an awards committee creates a shortlist, followed by the delegates of the Alliance voting.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Also, I wish to know how will nation's be nominated and voted on?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Also, shall we include a category of Governance? How effectively a nation is governed, democracy is maintained.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I feel like that would also have very wide definitions.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Very much agreed. However, other awards could also be given instead that would stifle the popularity aspect.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Also, shall we include a category of Governance? How effectively a nation is governed, democracy is maintained.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe the date of the ceremony will be 14th August, the eve, you demit office?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's the current plan, however it may be subject to change.
Unless anybody wishes to add anything else we shall move on.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I see the date fine as it's also a weekend. However, we need to decide on potential hosts this time.
None from me and Vishwamitra will no longer be present in this session anymore.
Thank you.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would cover the next item which asks for suitable session times, however this would be best suited towards the poll.
As we have nothing left to discuss, I shall give delegates 5 minutes before we conclude for this evening.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Stormhold is no longer present. Thank you all.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Assuming that nobody as anything else they wish to add, this session is formally adjourned.
Thank you to everyone who has turned up tonight.

Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava is present.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is present.
Jules-Belgica: 
Belgica is present
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Stormhold is intermittently present.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Atiera is intermittently present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Australis is present.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present.
(Again)
ShayanSJ - Kranoya: 
Kranoya is Present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let's get started, then.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
First on the agenda is discussion for future applications for the Fair Voting Act.
Logan Ross put it like this, yesterday; 
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
will continue
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The floor is open for discussion.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It's my opinion that a voter delegate role and continuing to use the PollMaster bot is the easiest solution because it doesn't change the voting process at all. If a delegate goes missing, all it takes is another delegate to ask someone from the Bureau to remove that person's voting role and give it to another delegate of that nation
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur with Mr. Mullins.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava concurs too, with Mr. Mullins.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Nation-only voting removes individualism within the delegacy. Where I struggle is to find out whether that is a good or a bad thing.
ShayanSJ - Kranoya: 
I agree becuase it's not fair for a country has more delgates to have more votes
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It provides an equal voice for each member state.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Agreed.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Some states with more delegates than others have more voting power than states with less delegates.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
True, I think delagete voting also encourages nations to grow.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The issue that has limited a lot of the standard procedures for national voting is the section in the Charter that means all votes must be confidential. To maximise the potential of national voting, I feel it is in the best interests of the Alliance for the section to be removed from the Charter via amendment.
ShayanSJ - Kranoya: 
I agree
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe in nation-based voting. As an alliance between nations these things should be decided on a nation basis, not delegate.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Voting within an organisational setting such as this is a political statement. It should not be confidential.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe voting shouldn't be confidential.
People deserve to know how their representatives are voting.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I see where you're going here. This would allow for non-anonymous reaction voting. I think it would be beneficial
Membership votes should probably stay anonymous, but other votes might not need to be
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
That's a matter of the individual member-state and not the organization.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur. Having membership and expulsion votes be non-anonymous could cause some hurt feelings and make nations hesitant to vote the way they want.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Tesforia is present, and I concur with the delegate from New Athens.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
If votes must be confidential, then people can't say how they voted.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
We could use a simple aye/nay voting channel if we made this amendment, it would allow officials to quickly check if two delegates from the same nation have voted.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And would remove the need for the aforementioned voting delegate roles, which in my opinion complicate the whole process.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Membership votes should absolutely be confidential.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
But it would require the chair to manually count votes. That's a lot of work and could cause delays
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Though I am in favor of an aye/nay system for other matters.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I feel as though assigning roles may be simpler than having people count votes and check who voting every time we vote.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
There are less than 30 member states.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra will  intermittently withdraw.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We could even have applicants say who their voting delegate would be in their application, we already ask who their delegates would be.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Not really. It would take less than a minute.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That number is constantly growing.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think that is a great idea.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I agree that each member state should get one vote.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's national voting, which we've already passed.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Yes, I recall that now.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I honestly don’t believe that asking for people to be roled with a specific voting role can be all that difficult. Unless a change happens or new members are admitted, they won’t really have to do much aside from when we first implement the program.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I agree
Our voting process could remain the same
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I concur. This could be a simple administrative role.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
PollMaster lets you set which roles can vote. Just set the Voting Delegate role to have access and you have national voting
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Looks like we've established some pretty solid ideas for the Fair Voting Act's future applications. Are there any more comments on this topic?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
None here.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
None from me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from Waterside Park.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
None from Elava.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Right, moving on then, we're looking at the CA Awards Ceremony, to take place on 14 August.
We still need a definitive list of what awards to give out.
Of course the standard awards like the prestigious Lycon Cross and the Cupertino Service Ribbons.
But also we should include awards for core aspects of micronationalism.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Possibly an award having to do with a delegate improving their nation drastically?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Do we want more regal awards like the Lycon Cross and Service Ribbon or are we also thinking about superlative awards, like a best session attendance award etc?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think that'd be an excellent idea.
The following were proposed a while back: 
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Those seem like good ideas for awards in my opinion.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I disagree strongly with F, like I said it will turn into a popularity contest and there is a wide definition of what makes a micronation the micronation of the year.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
A list to be expanded to be sure but great progress so far.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur. This doesn’t feel like an award this alliance should give out.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Most improvement?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Ah, most improved. I would love for that to be included.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It was an award that also showed up in the GUM Awards.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Huai Siao  is present
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
So do we want more awards for individual delegates?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is again present.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Stormhold is again present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Personally, I think the two awards we have in place already cover that. These awards are primarily intended to recognise nations.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
As for likely popularity-oriented awards, I concur that we should avoid giving those out wherever possible.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Huai Siao is present again
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I am not familiar with the Lycon Cross to be honest. But if memory serves me right is the service ribbon either for retired delegates or CA member state citizens?
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
That said, are awards based on popular vote? Or vote by committee after a period of nominations by petitioners and/or the committee itself?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I concur. The community has enough aspects of popularity-contest already. However I do not oppose awards based on merit.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The CA Service Ribbon covers that
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava will soon be present again.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes that’s what I said when I was asking if that’s what the service ribbon was.
Thanks for the clarification.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The Lycon Cross is an award only able to be given out once per chairmanship term for delegates who exhibit the highest level of dedication to the CA.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Of course it is named after Jayden Lycon...
Textbook definition of dedication.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I mean, he was the founder.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If I remember correctly, this was awarded through nominations from the community followed by the Chairman deciding the recipient.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I was incredibly honoured to have received it myself a few months ago. Since then, I've seen several delegates who've stepped up to the challenge and are also worthy of receiving it.
Alas, I am getting off topic. Are there any more comments regarding the awards ceremony?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Interesting. I don’t believe that it is in the CA Navbox.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I don't believe it is even mentioned once on MW.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
There's no article about it at the moment.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well, that would explain why. I have nothing further on this topic, though.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let's move onto membership applications, then.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park will no longer be present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next up is the second reading of the Duchy of Pontunia's application.
Next up Duchy of Pontunia 
Duchy of Pontunia</div>
Pontunia, officially the Duchy of Pontchartrain-Maurepas, is an independent micronation that amicably seceded from the Austenasian Crown Dependency of New Pontunia in February 2021. It is comprised of various residential properties and two public parks declared independent from Metairie, Louisiana under the leadership of Duke Andrew I.</div>
Mats - Belgica: 
due to him needing to go.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe the worries presented at the last session over their sovereignty and stability issues are valid. But I still don’t know where I stand in regards to this applicant.
Mats - Belgica: 
I believe Pontunia in the past has been a 'weird' micronation, I have heard some things about them that are questionable, but I do not know how they have changed, so I will abstain for now.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt but I'm still unsure on where I stand.
Here's their updated server invite, by the way.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
They seem to go in and out in union with Nichensbourg.
And whenever they pursue a path of self-determination they seem to always resubmit under another.
Mats - Belgica: 
Indeed, they have joined and left 3 different nations now, if I am correct.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Stormhold is no longer present.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
To be frank, for myself I think that their sovereignty won't last very long. However I see that it makes sense to give them a chance.
Observership would be optimal.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Which is also inevitable if we choose to accept them so I would vote for.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Shall we now move on, then?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe so.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Yes
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Here we go, here's the second reading of Fesmar's application.
Fesmar
Fydtroust Fesmarian Empire</div>
The Fesmarian empire is a Micronation located in Cornwall, whilst originally started March 12th 2018, the kingdom represented a resolution to the post second empire power vacuum. Unlike its predecessors the empire prioritizes equality amongst all people, alongside democratic freedoms. Laws previously seen as restricting, such as restrictions on ...</div>
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
NO!
I cannot make it more clear than that.
For reasons as obvious as the sun in the sky.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There was a considerable amount of people yesterday who wanted to afford them a chance.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I received this from them, yesterday.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Frankly I believe that is untrue.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Interesting.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Could you explain why you hold this opinion?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Having observed them for 2 years now they have never told the truth regarding their ability to stay in one form of government
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'd like to give them the benefit of the doubt.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I'd like to draw a line somewhere with that benefit of the doubt concept.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think if we afforded them the benefit of the doubt then the same would go with Potunia, or where is the difference?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Of course. I previously stated that if they exhibit significant instability whilst a member of the CA, we can always put up an expulsion vote, it's not the end of the world.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well we could do that for every applicant.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava is again present.
Mats - Belgica: 
I think that the nation will experience some instability, they are currently having elections, one of them is socialist and the other is communist, I believe that due to the ideology of the two candidates troubles can rise due to them wanting to abolish the monarchy, I know of the communist candidate that this can/will be one of his plans. If the nation stays like it is right now I think there will be no problems, but if one of the candidates tries something then there will be a crisis, and due to the ideology this chance is high. But like said, if they stay like they are right now, and stable, then I think they should be accepted.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is no longer present.
ShayanSJ - Kranoya: 
I should leave because I Should go somewhere, Kranoya no longer Present
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Please correct me if I'm wrong. But is it not just important that they can be stable in terms of their connection with the CA?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The CA is an alliance between nations. Their nation should matter more than their delegates.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe their internal affairs show their professionalism.
Mats - Belgica: 
I can confirm that the past 2 years have been very bad for Fesmar, they have experienced a lot of instability.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
And you of all can confirm how many times they have settled on one form of governance just to break the expectations and change next week.
Mats - Belgica: 
Yes.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I honestly can’t find the right Fesmar when I look on microwiki. When I asked for a link to their discord a bit ago I was told it was limited access.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Mr. Miller, would you be willing to admit them and vote to expel if they become unstable again?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Their promises of ability to mature are nothing but a projection of their current stance and not their future.
Mats - Belgica: 
I sadly have worked together many times with Fesmar, and all of those times the relation ended faster then expected due to instability.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Why not do the same with Potunia?
I am trying to find out the difference between the two.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
If it is not possible to find good, up to date information about a micronation online. Then the nation is not suitible for any foreign relations.
Mats - Belgica: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Fydtroust_Fesmarian_Empire">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Fydtroust_Fesmarian_Empire</a>
Fydtroust Fesmarian Empire</div>
The Fesmarian empire is a Micronation located in Cornwall, whilst originally started March 12th 2018, the kingdom represented a resolution to the post second empire power vacuum. Unlike its predecessors the empire prioritizes equality amongst all people, alongside democratic freedoms. Laws previously seen as restricting, such as restrictions on ...</div>
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I've already said I'd be willing to do that with Pontunia.
Mats - Belgica: 
This is the most recent
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
This would be Pontunia's first promise of improvement, and Fesmar's millionth.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well yes I know that because it was in the application. I was referring to when I’m looking on my own.
Mats - Belgica: 
My bad.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I must have missed that, apologies.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
No worries, I appreciate the willingness to help, though!
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
That is a hard question.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It’s an odd thing to already be considering expulsion when talking about an applicant.
Mats - Belgica: 
Well, Fesmar is a very special case.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I am not Mr. Miller. But this does seem like unnecessary administrative work. Instead give them a special term of observership?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
In my own personal opinion I believe our dealing with Fesmar is but a waste of our time. I am really not convinced that just because the case of Fesmar is subject to new opinions, that this time it'll work.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What do you mean?
Mats - Belgica: 
I admit, that in the past they have experienced instability due to my own actions but this was in 2019, after 2019 they still experienced a lot of instability due to the leadership and the citizens being, very special lets just put it like that.
Every time I worked with them it ended badly, and Mr Miller can confirm this.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I mean that they could maybe be given observership. But their required time to be admitted as a full member is longer. In that time they will show if they truly hold true to their word of improving. An extra eye would be kept on their state.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I am not basing my opinions from experiences with Belgica.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
They would be given observership either way, but I don’t believe there is precedence for what you are suggesting. And honestly I’m not sure why we would do so.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Right
Mats - Belgica: 
I think this would be the best option, I think they have much potential, but they somehow manage it to become unstable every month or so, and even now they have a small chance that they will become unstable again due to the candidates being anti-monarchist and the nation itself is monarchist.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
That is true. If there are no procedures for this and exceptions are not to be made. Then they should not be given membership.
Mats - Belgica: 
But if the CA can help them, they can become a good and decent micronation.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
First they need to help themselves.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
It is what the CA is for, right?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think it’s worth note that we are trying to make Fesmar work a lot more than we try to make other applicants work.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
To help, to inspire.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Indeed, I personally believe there should be a lot more the CA does to actually help member nations, but that is a completely different topic.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Yes, its a different topic.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
An applicant still must come a certain distance themselves before proving that anything we help won’t go to waste.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Expecting the CA to help and inspire Fesmar is like looking for survivors in the ruins of Pompeii
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
To give up is to fail the mission charter.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
There is always the chance to find one person who survived the volcano and lived in the ashes for thousands of years isn't it?
Mats - Belgica: 
They have the will power, but the people leading the micronation, from my experience have barely changed from back when I was part of Fesmar.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Until we can provide aid to nations outside the CA, I don’t know how much more we can do for Fesmar at the moment. But I would love to see applicants be able to receive help, we have the CASC for that reason.
Which, should be noted, isnt really used.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
To give up and let the micronation die is bad for micronationalism. Then there will be more of micronations that have an impecible record, and less of nations that have a long history that contributes to a richer culture and a richer and stronger country.
Mats - Belgica: 
I propose, like some others, that we give them observership and then we will see how it works out.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
If we believe the Micronation will die without CA observership, it’s probably an indicator that they aren’t ready.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
They will not die, they will change.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
This is true. But it is not what I meant when I wrote that.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It’s our job to help, not to prop up. I really do hope I’m not coming across as only being against Fesmar, I feel this way for any applicant of this nature.
Mats - Belgica: 
And that is the problem, they change too much, they dont hold onto one thing.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
And honestly, when is the last time the CA really helped a member internally?
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I think we should start comming to some conclusions, we are dragging on.
Elava will oppose them.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Indeed, I think this does give way to a topic that should be discussed thoroughly at another time.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes, let's move on to the final membership application.
Mats - Belgica: 
It can give the leaders the will to go on.
To be part of something greater
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Then they should have the will to establish themselves enough to be here.
That come across much harsher than I intended, apologies.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Next week they will adopt an isolationist policy and cut their observership.
Mats - Belgica: 
That can happen, but there is also a possibility that it does not.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We can’t deal in hypotheticals, but I do believe it’s time to move on, so I’ll say nothing further on this.
Mats - Belgica: 
I have said everything that has to be said and that I wanted to say.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Same goes for me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Moving on then
Next up is the second reading for the Berry Kingdom.
Berry Kingdom</div>
Berry Kingdom (BK) is a sovereign micronation which has multiple territories, provinces and cities as well as rich nature.</div>
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Nice flag.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This one will be difficult I feel.
Their leader made Micronear, correct?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Berry Kingdom is a micronation for everyone who loves berries
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Which is a great resource, but also we have to look at the Micronation which doesn’t look like it has as much development put into it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe so.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
“The state is democratic, but an emperor with absolute power rules until the state will acquire at least 1000 citizens.”
And also their second decree creates a secret police.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I do not believe that this micronation has the micronational attitude that the CA members share. Elava will oppose membership.
Mats - Belgica: 
Belgica will abstain.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don’t know, it’s difficult to fully oppose this because we see what their leader can do it’s just like they are focusing on that rather than the kingdom.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The kingdom with an emperor.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The democratic kingdom with an absolute emperor.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Their leader may be a great micronationalist. But it's the nation that is seeking membership. Who said earlier that the CA is about nations, not their delegates?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What I’m saying is it’s disappointing that there is potential here we can’t use.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I will remain abstained on this application.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I am not supporting their membership, but I can atleast notice that like the others there is a real chance for them in the future.
Just, probably not here yet.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Yes, like the previous nation. But I feel that the attitude of the nation is not what the other members share here. We may help to change a nation, maybe. But changing their micronational attitude is not appropriate and should be left for them to decide.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I have nothing further on this applicant at this time.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Me neither.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If there are no further comments on this application, I see fit that this session will be adjourned at 00:50 AWST (6 minutes time).
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava too.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
A successful, 1hr and 20 minute long session.
A big thank you to everyone who attended today's session and made some valuable contributions.

Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava will be briefly present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
So first on our agenda is about the Fair Voting Act.
As like past sessions, we shall discuss different applications for the act, now that it is voted in power.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d9uGnCQ2nErH0HrhlVBtokSjHnOKX3ZH9CQqBmNFPdo/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1d9uGnCQ2nErH0HrhlVBtokSjHnOKX3ZH9CQqBmNFPdo/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Here is the Act by the way.
In terms, we know that we are trying to move to national voting, instead of delegate voting.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The floor is open.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We're currently planning for the entire alliance to switch back to national voting after our unsuccessful last attempt.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It's my opinion that a voter delegate role and continuing to use the PollMaster bot is the easiest solution because it doesn't change the voting process at all. If a delegate goes missing, all it takes is another delegate to ask someone from the Bureau to remove that person's voting role and give it to another delegate of that nation
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava maintains it opinion that voting should simply be done with a delegate voting role and unconfidential votes.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I personally believe nation voting would remove the part electoral college thing we have where more delegates for a nation could mean more votes on someone for denying or accepting.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur. Part of the reason that the National Voting Act failed was because it threw a major wrench in the system. Keeping everything familiar will ensure the Act remains in place, while also keeping voting activity relatively high.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don’t believe an “electoral college” thing should be encouraged considering nations can just add delegates to get more votes, there no real reasoning or justification behind that system.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I'm not encouraging it.
I want to remove it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I see, I misread the tone of your message. I completely agree then.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
For example, Qaflana has 3 delegates.
Would it be okay for us to vote 3x that of another nation?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Of course not, but that's why this exists. At this point we're just discussing how we want to implement it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, I don't think there is any problems with Pollmaster.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The issue is trying to verify that only 1 delegate has voted.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think you can implement a thing where someone with a specific role can vote.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'll take a look in a bit.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Member only channel?
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Role only*
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
There is. I utilize it in Atieran Parliament for every vote I put up.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes there is
In the pm! advanced setup you can specify which roles can vote
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah so you can have a main voter role to signify only one person can vote.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Exactly
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
And then nations in their own time have a discussion on votes.
Decorum please by the way.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Even then nations would still need to decide on who would be the votee.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don't think that should really be a problem.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe most nations already have a primary/secondary/tertiary delegate system in place, so I don’t see that being an issue.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
By default it can be the discord user listed in the application. After that they just need to ask a member of the Bureau if they want it changed.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Perhaps we can set up a delegates spreadsheet for each nation to verify votes.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
As I’ve maintained for awhile, these little issues that we want member nations to decide on isn’t asking much.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Nations could go off of how often someone attends meetings, but then again if nations are going to decide on who is going to vote it shouldn't really matter.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Voting delegates, including who is the voting delegate and if a voting delegate goes missing, should be on the responsibility of their nation, not the CA to micromanage.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur. I don’t think discussing what delegate will vote is the most efficient use of our time.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur also.
Does anyone wish to add anything further?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, moving on.
Now we have the CA Awards Ceremony. We already planned for it to take place on 14th of August a Saturday.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Australis is intermittently present.
Deleted User: 
Oskonia is int. present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
A few months ago, when we were planning out different events we had gotten a couple of awards proposed, namely 
Currently we are looking for more awards.
Deleted User: 
What about “best new micronation”?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The floor is open for discussion.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
In the previous session we discussed the possibility for awards similar to highest session attendance
Also most improved micronation
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think the concerns over item F have been reiterated enough, avoiding popularity contest awards.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava is no longer present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
For nations under a year old?
Deleted User: 
Yes.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I feel like that may also become a popularity issue, honestly.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, that could work. Bring some fresh faces a awayrd.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Otherwise it becomes an ego boost for those involved.
Culture would definitely be an interesting one.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It could be reworded for most developed recent nation or something.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Someone proposed design as well.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Like best flag design?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
In all fairness, awards ceremonies always have the risk of becoming a popularity contest. No matter what categories are being awarded, care must be taken to avoid such a popularity contest.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Like best flag design?
Deleted User: 
Micronation of the Year is just going to be a popularity contest as well
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Indeed, but categorized awards have a lesser likelihood of becoming such due to the less general nature.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That's why it might not be used
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We could do something like most edits/changes to a micronation in the past year.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Does that encourage instability?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
It honestly might.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well, I mean improvements and such.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Ah, I didn’t interpret it as such. Very well.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I know there are people here who edit almost everyday, where as some people not so much. So like the people who edit their page with the most improvements and such would get a award.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As in their MicroWiki page?
Because wouldn't it be better to award based on best Wiki page instead?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I guess, but it would be cool to award on who actively improved their page as opposed to someone who already had their page good.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
And yes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Fair.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Does anyone wish to add anything else before we move on?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Nothing here.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Atiera will no longer present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright moving on.
Next we have a discussion the Cupertino Peacekeeping group as proposed by Mr. Carson.
I hand the floor to Carson.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention" title="Carson#6255">@Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon</span>
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Thank you, this was a concept that I brought up with the Chair in private messages. The concept is that we resume the use of the Peacekeeping programs that the CA had in the past, or advertises on the microwiki, for both the old purposes and new. One of the main ideas in the resumption is that it would be comprised of people who actually physically live within member states as to have them be available for local peacekeeping but also as a ground force to help implement new Cupertino Projects.
I feel like if we did this, and we got a ground team of people in member states we could reliably provide what we wanted to in the past, but also expand the horizons of what the CA can do for member states in terms of physical tangible growth and help.
That is the current, base, idea for what the project may look like obviously it would need to be expanded upon but for discussion on that, I yield the floor.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think that we should revive it.
It seems to have gone out just from inactivity though, so we may need to rework the programs however.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It also would be a way to get more citizens of member states involved in the alliance, as currently only really delegates can truly get involved.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I feel like we should give it a different name to ensure that people don't inadvertently mistake it for a military or something.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well we could do that if we wanted to remove the peacekeeping aspect of it, but honestly I would like to see aspects of that be kept. The peacekeeping parts would only really be usable in micronations that are near to other micronations, but we have seen that in the past.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah. I got confused with the name for a second.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We could somewhat reword it instead of outright changing it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The point of expanding the uses for it, in my opinion, is to ensure that it wouldn't fall into inactivity due to it being used exclusively for that.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That makes sense.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This program, if we implemented it strongly and well, could open so many doors for this alliance to provide development and help to its members.
For some of the programs it either is more digital or it relies on delegates to do the work, but with this, the hope atleast, is that we can have dedicated teams to assist in the work.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, I think it should be revived. It would definitely add support for members.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The physical side of micronationalism is something I feel we overlook at points due to the commitment involved in it, the clean-up program was a nice step and proof that we can do real work in member states.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah it is absolutely achievable.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Does anyone wish to add anything else before we move onto membership time?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I will work more indepth to get clear cut ideas and aspects for this program, but I brought it up to soon before the session to truly do so with justice to the program.
But I have nothing further at this time.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright.
So first we have;
Berry Kingdom
Berry Kingdom</div>
Berry Kingdom (BK) is a sovereign micronation which has multiple territories, provinces and cities as well as rich nature.</div>
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Sorry, I forgot I had parttaken in this session. Vishwamitra will withdraw.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Their MW page could use some work.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The overall tone of their micronation was brought up as a potential issue at the last session.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Their website are not really I guess proof that they should be in here.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It seems like more effort went into the micronear project than the nation itself.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah it feels somewhat egotistic in a way.
Berry Kingdom (BK) is a sovereign micronation which has multiple territories, provinces and cities as well as rich nature.
<strong>Population</strong>
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There just isn't much in terms of the nation itself, which I mentioned was disappointing because of the work we've seen its founder do on micronear.
Deleted User: 
Hmm… I’d say no for now.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'll probably abstain at best.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Berry Kingdom recognizes each micronation active within a real territory. Nature of the Berry Kingdom is very rich and diverse.
No from me.
Deleted User: 
Let’s move along.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Moving on.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Fesmar

No from me.
Leaning abstain, though.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This is their 4th time applying right?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Morwenna has explained the reasons for Fesmar's instability in <span class="mention">#formal</span>, however it'll still be a no from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
hello, I do not think I formally reintroduced myself to alot of you. I will begin with my personal self. I am Morwenna Fydtroust, I know many of the members here knew me as Kenneth, and id like to address that if people do not mind. 
Probably a no from me.
Moving on.
Duchy of Pontunia 
Duchy of Pontunia</div>
Pontunia, officially the Duchy of Pontchartrain-Maurepas, is an independent micronation that amicably seceded from the Austenasian Crown Dependency of New Pontunia in February 2021. It is comprised of various residential properties and two public parks declared independent from Metairie, Louisiana under the leadership of Duke Andrew I.</div>
Deleted User: 
Abstain from me, but leaning support.
I know a lot of delegates have strong opinions on Pontunia, so go ahead.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah abstain from me also, Andrew is not a good delegate IMO.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'd abstain as well.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We had to remove Pontunia from losing independence and then he said Screw Cupertino, I'm out
Anyone wish to add anything before we close out?
Deleted User: 
No.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
None from Australis. Apologies for my lack of presence here, the UEFA Euro Final was on.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's alright.
Deleted User: 
England, unfortunately, lost.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright with that, I will be closing today's session. I am happy that we could do tons during this session, any further chatter should be taken to a different channel.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unless anybody wishes to add anything we shall begin.
Anthony I - Saspearian:

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
First off I would like to begin with a Games Evening event.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
Wegmat is present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The games part of the digital summit was very popular with attendees, and considering that we have another month I believe that we have sufficient time to host another event.
The floor is open to discussion and suggestions.
During the summit we played Jackbox and Roblox, both of which were popular.
Deleted User: 
Jackbox was very fun.
I won the Quiplash 3 game.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would love to participate. Unfortunately, I had to miss the virtual summit due to prior commitments, so I hope I can participate this time around.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I agree. It seems pretty easy to set up for games like that. Also I have a server computer I'd be willing to host game servers on for the events.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Huai Siao is no longer present

Jackbox is a very good game for parties, like this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Jackbox was very fun.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Although I may be unable to participate, I would be supportive of hosting an event like this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
In addition it provides a formal time for delegates to interact with their peers in a fairly close setting.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I believe we should host a Jackbox event again.
Deleted User: 
True.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Please can delegates stop reacting with emotes.
Enough.
This is a formal setting.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Floriland is present.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
If we want to start CA gaming servers for members to play games like Minecraft/Roblox/CSGO/halo etc, I can host them for free with 99% uptime
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
That would be great.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would support a CA Minecraft server, however I unfortunately only have Bedrock which would create issues.

Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
It all depends on the time of day for me.
Deleted User: 
Later in the day would be ideal.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I reckon that we should start at 19:00 UTC perhaps?
Deleted User: 
Give me a second.
That'd be 2 PM CDT, 3 PM EST.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I wouldn’t be able to attend at that time.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
That would likely work, though I may be 15 minutes late or so.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
But it is fine for me
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
I shall presume that is a no so I shall move on.
Next up we have the CA peacekeeping project.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This was discussed during a prior session, whilst during this time Carson has provided us with a draft for the final document highlighting it.
Hold on and I shall upload it now.
I'd recommend that delegates look through the document before we discuss it.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I apologize to everyone but Novus Hierosolymis will no longer be present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
The floor is now open to discussion.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I think it needs a different name.
Deleted User: 
Mr. Ross, for future reference, please download, or tell the people that are making the document to download their acts as PDF files. .docx is a confusing filetype.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Because it could give many people the impression that it’s an army instead of a development agency.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I actually quite like the idea. From my understanding of the proposal, this allows citizens of member nations to get involved with the Alliance and its mission without taking on the full responsibility of being a delegate. And more participation is never a bad thing.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Coincidentally, two days ago a citizen asked me how they could get involved in participation with the CA in a manner similar to this. I think this proposal could be beneficial.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Projects like Twin Towns or the CA Charts will be benefitted in untold ways by this document.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Deleted User: 
No.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is present.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
I approve of the idea.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright next up I'd like to discuss implementing dual delegates for projects.
Some projects such as the CA Music Chart have suffered from inactivity, which I believe could be partially or fully alleviated by implementing numerous delegates which operate and supervise the projects.
This allows for some redundancy and a larger amount of activity within projects.
In addition, I will be looking into creating an act which ensures that future chairs must constantly check up on projects and delegates running the aforementioned project.
The floor is open to discussion.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I personally have nothing to say on the proposal.
Deleted User: 
I like this idea.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
for roles within projects which will be open.
Deleted User: 
It allows for more delegates to participate in the Cupertino Alliance's administration.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That as well.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
In committee-based organizations that I've been apart of in the past, the VP of the organization oversaw committee chairs and ensured that the chairs were actively working on the committee. I think establishing a committee lead for each committee that we create who will report to the Lt. Chair would be beneficial for us by ensuring someone holds accountability for our committees.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I support implementing something like that for projects.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Alright we shall move on then.
Finally we have the revitalisation of CAoNI.
This is a project that has seen consistent inactivity since its incarnation unfortunately, despite attempts to revitalise it.
I would therefore like to discuss with delegates ways in order to revitalise the project and make it more appealing for nations.
The floor is open to discussion.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am quite honestly unsure if it is worth trying to revive this project. We have tried multiple times, but the Alliance at large shows disinterest. I don’t know if it’s the best usage of our time and effort to keep reviving a project that has little to no interest.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I feel like the biggest obstacle right now is the form, which may require simplifying.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I concur.

The floor is open to discussion.
My initial opinion was a support, however I just noticed that they changed government 5 times in 1 month.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is present.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
AnxieTea: 
What was I pinged for?
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I support them despite the government changes, it seems like they have the interests to develop their micronation just not a full idea of their creative intentions.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Wasn't there another state who also had Oblasts?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would have to guess the session.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
This is fair, but it is reasonable for us to prefer to wait for them to reach a stable government situation

At least they're thinking about the children.
Other than that it'll probably be a no from me.

The national drink isn't an issue but their claim size and number of citizens brings doubts for me
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I brought it up just for the tone issue.
This seems like a fun thing between friends but, I don't think they are far enough along to be here yet.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on?
Republic of Hellerk
For you, we are committed to the end | Iosoa</div>
Iososian Union website - IOSOA is the official UM website that provides access to information published by all UM institutions, agencies and bodies.</div>
Hellerk</div>
Hellerk, (prounounced Hell-erk) is a micronation that was established on 26 June 2021, by President Hirel. The micronation is located in Hirta. Hellerk is a Semi-Presidental constitutional republic. The national animal of Hellerk is the Deer.</div>
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
They seem professional and serious just based on their application
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their delegate seems very argumentative and abrasive from what I've seen on MicroWiki@Discord.
<div class="quote">Hellerk Airlines fleet is very small with just 1 plane, saab 340. Hellerk Airline travels to Scotland and Northern Ireland, Hellerk Airline is hoping to open more destinations in a year or 2.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
Why do they not recognize Afghanistan? That’s odd.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">however HSEASA will be exploring space for humans to stay on, two possible planets that HSEASA will study is Luna and Mars.</div>
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Is it that French person who claimed to own a multi-million dollar company or am I thinking of someone else?
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I concur. Seems like they might claim to use these aircraft from a local airline despite lack of ownership
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Hold on I'll find their username.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It is not impossible for the plane to be a small 4-seater owned by their family
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
VBJJ#1111
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That is an incredibly common practice in some places, such as alaska
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
They claim to own a Saab 340 which is a large turboprop aircraft.
I have serious doubts that they own and operate such an aircraft.
It'll have to be a no from me.
James B. - Desert District: 
VBJJ began sending me DMs saying I am lying about my age and harassed me for a good period of time.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I'm not saying it's likely, but it's possible. He could be from a wealthy family. I'm just playing devil's advocate.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
This is a better reason to deny them if you ask me
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
Same here, but not just because of the plane conversation that is currently occuring.
James B. - Desert District: 
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Same here, but not just because of the plane conversation that is currently occuring.
Also the screenshots provided by James seem to emphasise this.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes it will most likely be a no here too.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
They are a no from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further before we wrap up for this evening?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Nothing here.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
None here.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright I'll give delegates 5 minutes for extra time before we conclude the session.
If nobody wishes to add anything further we shall wrap up tonight's session.
Thank you to everyone who has attended, it has been very productive this evening.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
First up on the agenda was going to be an announcement from the Honourable Chairman about the election, but I don't believe that he's here.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Speaker, could you kindly post the agenda here?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yeah.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I am also present, for Vishwamitra.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Wait, I've found it.
Here is the statement from the Chairman.

The lack of professionalism between individuals in each respective campaign is qu...</div>
As a candidate in the election myself, I assure the delegates of this organisation that I am incredibly sorry for the conduct that members of my staff have shown, and I would also like to assure you all that they have been reprimanded, Mr. Bornstein most strictly. I have removed him as my running mate de facto and am now running by myself.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Being a fellow candidate, I may ask Mr. Hamilton to reconsider his decision to remove Mr. Bornstein as his running mate, despite it being his personal decision and that of his campaign.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I also apologize to all who have seen the events unfold - it was an err on those in the Hamilton campaign, myself included, that these happened. I tried my very best to stop this from happening, but it has happened, and I hope it isn't repeated.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Respectfully, I have given him several chances, and he has thrown those chances away.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">I can't speak more about what is happening in your campaign, however, I think a last chance could be provided, and in respect to my comment posted in <span class="mention">#formal-members-pub</span>
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Phillip - Pibocip is present sorry for the tardiness I was in another meeting
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
All good.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
do you have anything else to say regarding your campaign before we move on?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
will be uphold and I'll continue to strive hard with respect with the pledge I have taken.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is intermittently present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Being away for the weekend, I can only wish I'd been able to step in to prevent the actions of this weekend.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I must add that I am extremely disappointed with the conduct of everybody involved, and I hope to see amends made henceforth.
Regardless, it is in the past so I see no reason why we cannot press forth with what we have learned.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I agree with the Honourable Chairman.
Right, I feel that we should move on to the next item in today's agenda.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I agree.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Considering that the games went well in the CA digital summit went incredibly well, there are plans in place to hold another such event, solely for games.
There is time left in this administration to host another, so I'd like to hear thoughts and ideas for when to host it, what to play, etc.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We would need some games that would allow for higher attendance, unless we want people in the audience in Jackbox, there was a considerable portion of attendees that weren't truly playing.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Jackbox was extremely popular last time, so I believe that we should primarily host jackbox again.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Any more ideas?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Maybe something like Roblox - that was popular last time.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And it's fun for all ages - I think that'd be a great idea.
It's also very versatile.
Lots of games and a high player count in servers.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's a lot more interactive as well.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Gartic Phone is another party-esq game we could have.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
However it may be worth investing in a VIP server on Roblox to prevent games being filled with random other players.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Gartic phone is very good.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Right, when should we host it?
The term expires on 15th August.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Next Friday perhaps?
It requires virtually no planning and I start my holiday then so it's good for me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That sounds good.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Should we move on, Mr Speaker?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Apologies, point of inquiry, this upcoming Friday or Friday on the 30th?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Does anyone have any more ideas or suggestions for the games evening?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe, this coming Friday, 23rd
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Are we inviting the general public again?
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Understood. Thank you for the clarification.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
You're welcome.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Burdette is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let's move on then, if there's no further suggestions.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe the honourable delegate from Northwood-Oregon had a question.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe we should.
I think there's still minor details that can be ironed out in the coming days.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Alright. Thank you, and thank you Mr. Martin.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next up is a revitalisation initiative for the Cupertino Area of Natural Interest (CAoNI) program.
<div class="quote">This is a project that has seen consistent inactivity since its incarnation unfortunately, despite attempts to revitalise it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I have to admit i'm not fully knowledgeable on this program, is there a document we could review on it?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
If it's seen consistent inactivity, we must identify why this is happening, or we'll end up going around in circles.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
for further info.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I think this would probably work better as a cultural/heratige program, as opposed to a natural one only.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Did anyone apply?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This is rather sad.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
As KWP is a city-state we cannot apply as we don't have any natural areas of particular interest.
We have some trees and that's it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The pairing aspect of it also seems odd for this type of program, but I can understand why it was a thought of concept.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's the issue, I think. A lot of nations don't have particularly significant natural areas.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
However if people could submit structures of national importance, it would be more successful.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Excuse my unannounced absence, I have returned.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
suggested would be a great idea.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Such as royal palaces, squares, monuments, etc.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon has some important wetlands conservation areas due to the history of the Black Swamp and its current conservation. But I believe it would be correct to say that for the most part many nations don't really have naturally important natural areas.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would agree with the delegate that Vishwamitra does have areas of natural importance, but not a large area.
Mats - Belgica: 
Much of Belgica’s lands are unused forests who stay like they are without Any interaction from people due to no intrests in it, but I dont know if it would contribute to the project.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I feel like in it's current state of only allowing natural areas will make us have to stretch to make such areas seem important enough for the program.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Moving it a culture based program is much better IMO.
Mats - Belgica: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, if there's are no more suggestions or ideas on this, let's move on.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Nothing here.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">Alright next up I'd like to discuss implementing dual delegates for projects.
^ Copied from previous session as it's the only resource I have for this.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I've noticed a lack of listening recently too.
If the music chart was published today it would pretty much just be Fumez The Engineer
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Not to reinforce the concept of it's inactivity, but I didn't really know this was a thing.
As such, I completely support having more people assigned to managing it and ensuring its activity.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
A central location for viewing and applying for projects would greatly benefit the Alliance.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace"><span class="mention">#job-bureau</span>
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's for jobs.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It could very easily be converted.
It's not used anymore.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
A list of all the projects and how to apply.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Would the Ministers hire such delegates?
Since each project is usually run by a Ministry.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
And I'm not talking about delaying it for a campaign to implement if elected, for political reasons. I'm talking about something to implement ASAP.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Did anyone apply?
<div class="quote">It could very easily be converted.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think that would be best.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Let's move on if there's no more activity for this topic.
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Next up is the Cupertino Peacekeeping group, presented by <span class="mention" title="Carson#6255">@Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon</span>.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I am going to reshare the document that was shared on behalf of me last session which outlines the goals of the program.
I have seen some good support around it the past previous sessions, which I am happy about, and I am working forward on cohesive legislation and plans for it, but I still would like to, naturally, hear other's ideas and opinions on it.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think this is a great idea.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Sounds like an excellent idea.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As before, I am fully in support of this proposal as it could be revolutionary for projects.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
As I've said, we implement this well the CA would be launched forward far beyond others in possibilities of what we could do.
It will take a lot of work, but it will be worth it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This is something that I'm definitely in favour of.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
The document is highly detailed and this project will benefit the Alliance, I'm sure.
Shall we move on?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
We shall.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I am hoping to have even more added to it, but I don't wish to share it until I have fully done. I have nothing more at this time.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Because the next thing was written by me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Next up is the Poll Neutrality Act, proposed by Jayden Dagsa. This is his first act, and reading through it I must say that I am proud of his work. You have the floor to present your act. You got this. 
Poll Neutrality Act</div>
Cupertino Alliance Poll Neutrality Act Statues of the Cupertino Alliance, 2021 Published by Authority                 Copyright Statement The Cupertino Alliance Printer holds copyright on behalf of the Government of the Cupertino Alliance and her member states. The Cupertino Alliance Printe...</div>
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
While the Poll Protection Act was a major piece of legislation that promoted neutrality in polls posted in the Alliance, I noticed that there were no provisions in regards to supporters or staff of a campaign being barred from gaining approval to post polls from the Chair. This is my reasoning for proposing said legislation. Any delegates can ask me questions in regards to this.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Sounds like a good idea.
Neutrality is key.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
So this would disqualify anyone who made an endorsement?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Yes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think it could be amended to include companies/publications owned by campaigns, i.e. SD for me, DSD for Dhrub.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I'll add that.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would just note that DSD is not fully owned by me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Otherwise great work, and I'm in favour of this act.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I share its 50% control only.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Companies acting in association, then.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I too agree with the act.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I don't think that for-profit companies should really be holding the polls either tbh
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Your suggestion has been added, Daniel.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The EAMS is a grey area tbh
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
owned or acting in association with a candidate
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm in charge, but that can change as it's also a micronational organisation.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Fixed.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Plus someone else in the org could just run the poll.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Thank you for proposing this act, Mr. Dagsa.
Does anyone have any questions or queries?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from me.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alright, stand by before we move on.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
My pleasure.
It was an honor to present my first proposal.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Me and Mr. Roy are dedicated to continuing to make this Alliance a better place, and to friendly cooperation with each other. Because of this, we've agreed to co-host this session. He will be taking over as speaker for the remainder of the session.
Mr. Roy, you are now the speaker.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you very much for giving me the chance to continue for the rest of the session as the Speaker.
The next on the agenda is the membership attainment divisions
The first being that of:
Socialist Federal Republic of Kopernik</div>
Kopernik, officially the Socialist Federal Republic of Kopernik (Polish: Socjalistyczna Federalna Republika Kopernika) is a self-declared enclaved independent state with little or no international recognition, and is commonly referred to as micronation by external observers. Kopernik is located in Eastern Europe, sits on the Silesian Upland, and...</div>
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I thought I recognised them.
Progressive Association.
Hmm.
I'll likely abstain.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They seem to have ties with Snagov, and I am not aware of them.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I've read about these before.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I have seen their delegate around.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Stormhold is present.
Apologies for my tardiness.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
All good.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
An abstain from me, government system was changed 5 times, and they have no proven internal stability, but they have signed a treaty with Snagov, which is a positive factor.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Actually, I change my position.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would be speaking to Mr. Gheorghe and try to get a better perspective on the nation
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Are they applying for observer status, or full membership?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would personally probably vote against, due to their instability, and their PA position.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Apologies for getting the question wrong, there's no separate application for observer or full member
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
PA?
I'm unfamiliar with the term.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Any nation applying, when accepted in the alliance becomes an observer some a fortnight or so, and then there's a second vote if or not to promote them as full members.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Progressive Alliance.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Progressive Association.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Progressive_Association">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Progressive_Association</a>
Progressive Association</div>
The Progressive Association is a micronational alliance created by Afrasiyab Jamshaid, and headed by the Council of the Progressive Association. It was formed on 2 February 2021.</div>
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I have no idea who they are, but I'm assuming from your comments that they're nothing to be associated with.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It seems to be run by Jamshaid.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Pretty shady stuff.
Tinakula's we couldn't get into the CA so we'll just make our own alliance
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Ahh.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe Novus Hierosolymis was a member of PA?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Which later devolved into bullying the Commonwealth of Ducie.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The nation has a professional way of expressing itself no doubt, but all in all I don't know how to view it.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Before NH.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, does anyone have anything to add on their application before we move on?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Sorry?
They left to the best of my knowledge thou.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It was Jayditaria, not Novus Hierosolymis as far as I can tell.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
In this case, I do recommend barring Kopernik from full membership at this time. If they apply to observer status, it'd not do this organization any real damage at this point.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
My bad.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They'd eventually be put to vote for promotion a fortnight after.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I have conflicting impressions on Kopernik, I would vote abstain.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We either need to separate the application process by a Charter amendment or generally abstain/oppose their application.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
As long as they can prove internal stability, I won't vote against them.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Given so many delegates wishing to abstain, my gut tells me to vote nay if I had the power to do so.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright shall we move on.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava is present.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis was part for a short time. 2 months I think.
We left on May 15.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The next one is that of theRepublic of Hellerk

The Guyanese flag in different colour
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think due to the discussion yesterday no one even noticed they are less than a month old.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The nation is very new, not at least a month
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Their delegate also had some less than favorable interactions with Mr. Bornstein.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That'd be a concern, however..
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
They seem very obnoxious. As if they're hurrying to cement themselves into the community.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
A hard no.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Definitely a vote against. They don't even seem to have read the application rules.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would agree. The Chair could reject them executively.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well Their people are often stereotyped as being mild, judicious, and loud.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
I'm gonna oppose to the application.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Do they fufill the requirement of being established as a 6 months old nation?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Not that I think of.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
3 months now, isn't it?
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
They're too new.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
And anyways, nope.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe the 6 months old requirement is relatively flexible, but not for a less than a month old.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
26 June was like 3 weeks ago.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Oh yes. My bad.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I believe they applied to the GUM and were executively denied.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
As I said, hurried.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe that to be tremendously funny.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
You have to have the characteristics of a 6-month old nation, which they do not have.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
They did?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I don't recall, but they maybe.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Indeed.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
My memory is somewhat hazy, so don't quote me on it.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Alright.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, shall we move on.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe we shall.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Please.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Indeed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The next is that of Northway
Republic of Northway</div>
The Monarchist 15th Republic of Northway, commonly known as Northway, is a micronation created in Essex once as a fun idea, and later re-established as a Rebellion against a school. Its founder and current king is Miles I with a presidency being established later on. On the 11th June, 2021, Northway became a member state of the Micronational Ass...</div>
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Northway?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I'd be oppose to their application and I'd point that the nation was executively rejected from GUM.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would oppose, however not because I deeply dislike the county of Essex.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is now present
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
As I said last session, this is more of a fun project between friends than a micronation.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Going to be abstaining: MW article looks average
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Rebellion against a school?
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Very little to go off the MicroWiki article.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm not sure I would support this nation. Abstain at best.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The nation claims to have citizenship all around their school
John Lakes - Floriland: 
That's a poor quality MicroWiki page.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Ditto.
Especially if English is their official language.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I wouldn't accept them.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Same.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Let's give it a couple months and see how they do in the community.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Its going to be a no from me.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I'm pretty sure we can observe their goings-on since they were recently let into the MA.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
To be fair, they were rebelling against a school.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Their current form is also from June.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
That made me laugh more than I care to admit.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
A hard no from me.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
I concur.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
A hard no.
Novus Hierosolymis will no longer be present.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
What I mean is that their current Republic (5th) has not had a chance to establish itself in any way.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'll abstain at best, but more than likely I'll oppose unless I see something soon.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
A hard no from me aswell.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Out of fear of breaching decorum, I'd like to state for the record that today's applicants so far seem to be borderline meme tier for lack of a better word.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It is honestly a slightly disappointing set.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava concurs.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Is there some sort of provision for executive denial of applications for being far too new, or because of extremely poor reputations or instability, etc.?
John Lakes - Floriland: 
I wouldn't say they're meme tier.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
There is, I believe. The Chair can executively deny nations.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Change one or two words and they would be. Hence ’borderline’.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Or, even, provisions for delegates to reach out and inform them (in case the Chair approves) that they'd likely face rejection.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What kind of authority does the Ministry of Membership of Attainment have over these applicants?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The Minister responsible has not issued any report in the recent times.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What kind of filters must they go through before they get to us, I am asking?
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I hate to use the word gatekeeping, but that seems to be what we need at this point. The CA already has its reputation to worry about. Letting anyone with a pulse toss in an application and have them all make it to the floor seems burdensome to the organization.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The ministerial report helps a lot to filter out or provides a brief on the nation; however, due to the fact that the Minister has not worked on the report, it makes things a bit hard.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Why aren't they doing the reports?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe, busy schedule of the Minister.
The Chair had asked him to act on, but I doubt if the Minister has.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Aren't there commissioners?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am afraid, no.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The reports have never been compulsory.
Unfortunately
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They'd be in my opinion.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
If the Minister cannot discharge their duties, discharge the Minister.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
So they should step down or give the work to someone else. Minister positions should not be held on to just to have them. The work just comes with the title.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe the current minister has even advocated just getting rid of the reports in favor of just looking at their microwiki page, which I didn't see anyone agree with.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I do agree with the delegates. I would be informing the Chair to ask the Minister to publish reports.
Just to note, the Minister is Mr. Leon Montan.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
That he has remained the minister-responsible for so long is absolutely beyond me.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
(The GUM nearly collapsed from the problem of absentee secretaries and other executive staff at more than one point of its existence, and the CA is more vulnerable to this effect due to less internal inertia.)
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The minister doesn't seem to be busy, but instead be not doing them due to a personal disliking.
They've said 
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
In that scenario, he should simply tender his resignation or request for a change in portfolio.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
If that is the case, then please offer Mr. Montan another open position and replace with someone who is willing to do the work.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
There's just a few days for the current administration, I think the next administration should take note.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
He does have plenty to offer this organization, and there is no shortage of work to be done, I sense.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Both me &amp; Daniel have agreed to make this process way more active.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That is good to know.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'd be willing to take on the responsibilities of this ministry temporarily - If I wasn't the Asia/Oceania minister that'd be my next preference.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, theres nothing more in the agenda for this session, before ending, I would be glad to seek national reports if delegates are willing.
Delegates could tell a brief on recent activities in their nations.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Sure.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Please do, and thank you.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon has recently been getting more attention from local residents without our pushing due to the independent sharing of our microwiki page and nobility on Facebook. It is a boon for recognition locally.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
<strong>Elava</strong>
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Nice.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra had a small cabinet reshuffle last Saturday, some ministries were renamed and ministers were given additional charge. 
Just to note, I have been Vishwamitra's head of state on various occasions since 2007.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Australis is set to hold its second General Election next Saturday, with the incumbent Australissian Loyalist Front looking more and more likely to win once again. Foreign Affairs programs are going well, with Australis signing more treaties with nations.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
In the way of national reports, it's been a while since Stormhold has submitted one.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra and Australis set up a Council of Negotiation.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's true.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
What is this council?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I noticed Australis adapted a MRT policy similar to what Northwood-Oregon does. I hope it is working out well for you all.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It's intended to mend relations between Vishwamitra and Australis, they've suffered in recent months.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Yes, it has certainly sped up the process for putting MRT's into law.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We'd be updating our treaty with Australis, the current one's basically outdated.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I see. I applaud the effort gone into mending things if such a council has been created.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That is great to hear.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Indeed. It was yesterday we took the initiative to set up the council.
The Grand Duke joined today, as he was on a break.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
As an update on the Berard-Malloy convention, Mr. Ross and I are preparing a ceremony to choose the Committee members and open the convention to public signing.
Are any states here planning on signing the convention?
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I am unfamiliar with the Convention. Is there a place I can read its contents?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I have not given time to read the document, but I am interested.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Same.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Here is the document, it was first presented late in the Cupertino Digital Summit.
Berard-Malloy Convention on Territorial Disputes</div>

Please ignore the placeholder image which still appears in embeds of the document.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
There's a similar type of document in the Conference of Santiago
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I am not familiar with it, and no delegate while we were publicly writing it brought it up.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Its all find, as it's only me who keeps a contact with them and no one will bother. The content is important and I believe the two are different.
I think we could adjourn the session if no has anything to add.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I see, thank you for mentioning it.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
This seems nice.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is present again.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
I'd be interested in signing it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I will notify the parliament on the upcoming ceremony once I have enough information to do so. Thank you for the time to discuss this Mr. Speaker.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
and myself issued a joint declaration in regards to the degraded relations between Vishwamitra and Novus Hierosolymis - it can be read here: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qMiOaEEro1u0k_LSIf6_sa0cHoGWruvajK1mB_pi6X0/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1qMiOaEEro1u0k_LSIf6_sa0cHoGWruvajK1mB_pi6X0/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Indeed.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
We both have pledged to set our differences aside and continue to be brothers in arms, united in pursuit of a better future for both of our nations.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I definitely feel that our relations will be better now!
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I hope so.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Good to hear.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
who was scouting for potential federal monarchs, given my work in Novus Hierosolymis. The coat of arms and royal standard were subsequently updated to show the change in titles. New coat of arms below:
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Nice
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, I would be adjourning the session after 2 minutes at 10:00 pm IST
The session was for 1 hr and 30 minutes.
Session adjourned.

Hello everyone, welcome to the 110th session of the Cupertino Alliance, we have alot to get through today, so let's start.
Here is our agenda.

So first we have to discuss a Games Evening event
What we are thinking of is something like the summit where we play party games or something.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Currently we are looking for game suggestions.
The floor is open for suggestions.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe this was brought up, but Jackbox in my opinion would be a great and fun multiplayer game.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think jackbox went well, besides the face not a lot of people were playing.
Maybe have 2 games running at the same time?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Perhaps.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
I believe that having 2 games in different VCs would be good.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Minecraft is a good option that most people have access to as well.
Or maybe skribbl.io
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, we could split it up, and do switch arounds.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think gartic phone is a good one.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Someone proposed that we also create a Minecraft server, however this doesn't relate to the event.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Or even just among us.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I agree.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Summit died when roblox started, so I think we should probably not do that.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> Anything you wish to add before we move on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Mats - Belgica: 
I like this
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Summit died when roblox started, so I think we should probably not do that.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Alright moving on.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is Present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Next we have a statement from the current Chair, Logan Ross.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NT62dgRuje6RgC8o_CTayYvwWPOi-kZIzm_EplceVSk/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1NT62dgRuje6RgC8o_CTayYvwWPOi-kZIzm_EplceVSk/edit</a>

Chair of the Board 18 July 2021  Statement regarding the August 2021 Chair elections  The ongoing events related to the August 2021 Chair elections have left me disappointed and ashamed with both campaign parties.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I sincerely agree with the statement issued.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I agree with that statement.
Mats - Belgica: 
I’m neutral as I am not up to date with what happened.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
And I hope that Mr. Hamilton and Mr. Roy can make up their differences.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
There have been lots of arguments and just pure childishness between both candidates.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
They have, and personally I believe they have taken their reconcilliation too far.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Too far?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Too far.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
How so?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The dual government proposition.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I particularly fine with it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I am with Chris on this.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think it should be voted upon though.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It seems way too over the top for a long term solution.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Not decided by both candidates.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
(I prefer Chris, thanks)
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Apologies.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It is like if Biden was president for 2 years, and Trump was president with 2 years, they shouldn't decide that themselves, but more the people.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
At that point just shorten the term to 2 years.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Like so if the people of the alliance want it, they are going to get it.
We are our own alliance.
Anyone wish to add anything before we move on?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
If the delegates do not want the chairman, we vote him out. If we want another one, we vote someone else in at the next election. Simple as that.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Now we have the CAoNI revitalisation.
<div class="quote">This is a project that has seen consistent inactivity since its incarnation unfortunately, despite attempts to revitalise it.
If you weren't here for the CAoNI project, it is a project to protect areas of natural importance.
Like wildlife and such.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Honestly, this isn't a popular opinion but I think we should drop it.
This project has been struggling ever since it started.
Mats - Belgica: 
Belgica is no longer present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
CAoNI started as an idea in September, started in January, died in February.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is briefly present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The floor is open by the way.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I am honestly surprised that it even became a thing if no one was going to participate.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We tried revitalizing it in February, March, May and June and now July.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would be willing to see an overhaul of it, it’s current state needs to be altered if we wish to revitalize it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, it needs to.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Sorry what is CAoNI?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
for future referencing.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
As of May, no one has participated.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Oh that thing. I feel like we've spoken about it many times.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It feels like it, but it’s always a shame to abandon a program.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
So the project is essentially unsuccessful?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Then it'd probably be for the better to put an end to it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is no longer present. For the peacekeeping conversation a document was shared earlier, I apologize I will not be there myself for it, I didn’t realize there were two sessions today.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's alright.
We should just end it.
I don't think with all the resources available, delegates wont participate.
Does anyone wish to add anything else before moving on?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Nothing from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Moving on.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
The SCCC2020 exist and does something simmilar within it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
How many delegates participate in that?
Next we have Implementing dual delegates for projects.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Sough Convention?
Would you mind elaborating on that?
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
30 nations. It was not a CA thing.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well number.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Yes. Very good.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The only source I have for dual delegates is something that Logan said a previous session.
Some projects such as the CA Music Chart have suffered from inactivity, which I believe could be partially or fully alleviated by implementing numerous delegates which operate and supervise the projects.
I personally have to oppose this notion.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes, projects have suffered from inactivity.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I don't have much general insight or perspective on the administration of projects.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
But having 2 delegates running such projects will lead the way of arguments.
It's like why we don't have 2 presidents, or why ships don't have 2 captains.
It will just bring the projects entitled to worse activity.
The floor is open everyone.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
When you present it like that I agree. If this matter implies the dual administration of projects it is obviously not a very good idea.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

Nothing more from me.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">30 nations. It was not a CA thing.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Sadly we have to skip the Cupertino Peacekeeping Group notion because Carson isn't here.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
The Imperial Grand Duchy of Lundenwic is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I have the document here if you wish.
Then I shall disappear.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Please.
While Logan pulls the document we shall move on.
Now we have the Poll Neutrality Act.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I have read, and I support this.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I support this also.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
While this is a nice sentiment, it is not necessary.
Opinion polls are exactly that. Opinion polls. They can be warped and not reflect the true feeling of the voters.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think it's necessary, to eliminate all cause and effect.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Anyone conducting these will have bias, it is impossible to eliminate this bias.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True, but we could work on it specifically.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I could very well call myself neutral, while secretly supporting a campaign and run a poll claiming my preference the winner.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Saying It doesn't matter everyone's biased I rather have someone who is biased and doesn't act on it.
Of course we could always just not do opinion polls.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I would rather know the polls allegiance rather than it pretending to be neutral.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Or, we could do two opinion polls hosted by both delegates.
Find the odd one out.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
If the members find this necessary than so be it, but I truly believe this will push campaigning deeper into underhanded tactics.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This is something I can agree on.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Alright moving on to membership time.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Most likely, it would be the other way around; an entirely truthful poll that of which's alliegence you do not trust. However we need to make the best and most secure option in perspective of the situation, and as of now this bill is the closest we have.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Socialist Federal Republic of Kopernik
Socialist Federal Republic of Kopernik</div>
Kopernik, officially the Socialist Federal Republic of Kopernik (Polish: Socjalistyczna Federalna Republika Kopernika) is a self-declared enclaved independent state with little or no international recognition, and is commonly referred to as micronation by external observers. Kopernik is located in Eastern Europe, sits on the Silesian Upland, and...</div>
Hard no from me.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I'm intrigued. It would be a yes from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Apologies, my wifi is being awful tonight.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Doesn't exactly align with my views.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Socialism is neither my view. I lead the Free Fascist Party of Lundenwic.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well, it could add diversity.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Kopernik has clearly conflicting impressions, at least to my interpretation. It has a way of expressing itself which is much more mature and professional than those who one usually responds to with a hard no towards. However it has had a few issues with government and it does not appear to be very well developed beyond their wikipage.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
But the propaganda is witty and I think they could use the benefit of nuturing within this organisation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We have to do that next session.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I sent that 15 minutes ago...
Decorum.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Let's keep some decorum please
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Sorry.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
As well, regarding Kopernik, I don't believe the Speaker nor anyone else should consider their political views in concideration of the competence of the applicant.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This I very much agree with.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don't agree with the communist part of it, nor do I like the propaganda poster.
It is my current opinion as such.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
These have very vague functions upon the competance of the state itself I believe but as you wish.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Moving on.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
So I am guessing you were against Lundenwic's application given it is run by a fascist dictatorship?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I wasn't directly at the sessions of Lundenwic.
Northway
Republic of Northway</div>
The Monarchist 15th Republic of Northway, commonly known as Northway, is a micronation created in Essex once as a fun idea, and later re-established as a Rebellion against a school. Its founder and current king is Miles I with a presidency being established later on. On the 11th June, 2021, Northway became a member state of the Micronational Ass...</div>
That's all that was posted.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What is all that was posted?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No discord server.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
In the application.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Hm
Weird
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No discord server.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
And s former spanish crown I see as well, in their flag.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I thought this was no longer a requirement. Otherwise we should not be here.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The Monarchist 15th Republic of Northway, commonly known as Northway, is a micronation created in Essex once as a fun idea, and later re-established as a Rebellion against a school.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The what now?
The what now?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I'm trying to assess it. A discord server isn't required but it is greatly appreciated.
Anyways, it somewhat seems like a joke.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Again the nation shows much potential. There are a few other nations that were 'rebelling' or created at school.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Potential?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Personally, I think they need to work on their Microwiki page and then re apply.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Can you not see the potential? I think with some guidance and being introduced to the community might do them the world of good.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Are you being sarcastic Mr. Lewis?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I hate to say it, but they are like Austenasia
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
No. I am sorry that I am not clear enough.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think they need to make the first step of rewriting their Microwiki page before I can see it. It just seems like a joke, like rebellion against school, but if they add more to it outside of the nation I could see them being a asset.
Moving on.
Republic of Hellerk
For you, we are committed to the end | Iosoa</div>
Iososian Union website - IOSOA is the official UM website that provides access to information published by all UM institutions, agencies and bodies.</div>
Hellerk</div>
Hellerk, (prounounced Hell-erk) is a micronation that was established on 26 June 2021, by President Hirel. The micronation is located in Hirta. Hellerk is a Semi-Presidental constitutional republic. The national animal of Hellerk is the Deer.</div>
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Obnoxious is a very good word to describe Hellerk.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I can see that.
They have potential atleast.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
They have hurried and massively tried to cement themselves into the community in what can be comparable to desperation. Word has it they were executively denied to the GUM after recently applying. Not to mention they are 24 days old.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
It has the basics
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Too soon actually.
We only allow nations under 6 months if they already have the quality of a nation over 6 months.
They clearly do not.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe we should stick to the 6 month rule and wait to see what comes out of Hellerk. Their leader has had an unpleasant confrontation with one of our respected delegates as well.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I agree
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I see, and I agree.
I have to say though, pretty thought out page for it being created 14 days ago.
Anything else anyone wishes to add before we close out?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Indeed, though usually things that are hurried do not work in the long run. They should slow down a little and take a step back. It is not a speedrun.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, well that is it for this session of the Cupertino Alliance. As such, please move conversations to the respective chats. I am please with all we had to get through today, and I hope there is more to come.

Tesforia will be intermittently present.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is present.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, we seem to have enough to at least begin.
The first on the agenda is that of the discussion on Future Games Evening event
From what I've learnt, the games evening was very successful, productive and full of fun.
Members are free to discuss on the agenda.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I don't see how it is in the interest of the parliament to discuss literal fun and games on the very top of our agenda; and I would rather propose for future reference that a separate committee is set up to administer this so that the parliament may focus on more important matters.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava will be intermittently present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I concur. But seeing as it’s on the agenda, Elava would rather discuss it instead of discussing about discussing it.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with Mr. Miller.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The games were added to the agenda to discuss turning it into a regular event.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">I have supported to discuss such matters out of session at <span class="mention">#formal-members-pub</span>
That is the best way.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This isn't to discuss the past event.
Please read my message.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I would support the idea of replacing one session a month to one of these special sessions.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
This seems like a good idea actually.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Agreed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does anyone have anything else to add on?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Nothing from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I think we'd move on.
The next is the discussion on the Changes to election legislation
I am unsure of the existing election legislation and if that exists, and what changes would be add to it
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Was there no ellaboration on the changes?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
No, the agenda provided to me does not have anything on it.
Could you add to it?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would assume this means properly defining time periods for nominations, etc
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Seems like, but I do not have any adequate references to elaborate.
I'd be suggestive of moving to the next matter
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava concurs.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The next is the discussion on CA Song Exchange .
I think Mr. Martin would be the best person to speak on this.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I was just wondering if there's enough interest to make this a weekly thing.
Maybe an album exchange too.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I have not paid any interest to the whole Music thing that has been working for some months now.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I was on the song exchange. An album might be a bit much for me but a song was a good length, around 10 minutes to write a good review and that.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
It is interesting.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's meant to be a short thing, 100 words max on the review, so a song exchange seems better suited, but an album exchange every month or so might be interesting, that's all really.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I would like to be on a song exchange every now and then. I would just like some moderation since I would actually want to learn about new music and not just get ‘your mom - your dad’.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yeah, this weekend's one was a trial run.
Given how we had a meme song submitted, and one over 20 minutes, moderation seems like a good idea.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thanks for the comments.
Alright, we move on then.
The next is the discussion on membership attainment

They're professional, and it's an aye from me.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
A strong aye from me as well.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
According to their wiki page, they're not recognised by Austenasia.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They are recognized. They've formal relations with them.
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Austenasia#Ovrestlia">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Foreign_relations_of_Austenasia#Ovrestlia</a>
Foreign relations of Austenasia</div>
The diplomatic foreign relations of the Empire of Austenasia are implemented by the Foreign Office of Austenasia, led by the Chief Ambassador. The power to grant official diplomatic recognition of sovereignty lies primarily with the Monarch, but the Prime Minister and Chief Ambassador can also grant recognition if through a diplomatic treaty.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm assuming it's due to them being an ESL micronation so it might have been translated incorrectly, then.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava will no longer be actively present.
Deleted User: 
Oskonia is present.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
They appear to have four residents in Ontario, if one of them is willing it could lead to them joining a possible 3rd Toronto summit.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
On this; I do hope that they will get a new minister during this election. Leon’s activity as minister has been small and the comments he has made on this server were of passive aggression and pretty untastefull.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Deleted User: 
I also concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Lets hope that the Ministry formed after the election helps the alliance get an active minister.
Also, does anyone have anything else to comment on the membership attainment?
Deleted User: 
No.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Floriland is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As we do not have anything else on the agenda, we'd end the session.
The session was pretty short.

The 112th session is a American Session scheduled to be hosted on 25 July 202...</div>
We have a lot to go through, so let's begin.
First we have planning another game night.
I have learnt that it was a major success, so now what we need to plan is the timing and games of the next one.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
The games evening on Friday was a huge success for everyone involved, so I would therefore like to propose hosting it as a monthly event.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
The last one was a load of fun, so it would be great to do another one.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
It was a success and I believe it helps relieve a bit of stress and help members to interact with each other.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think that's a great idea.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">It was a success and I believe it helps relieve a bit of stress and help members to interact with each other.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Personally, I think that we should differentiate times between each one.
For example, the past Game Night happened at 11 am for me, and it may be worse for others.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is present.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
That is understandable and should be taken into account.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia will be sporadically present
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Indeed; it's well past four in the morning here, for instance.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Does anyone wish to add anything else before we move on?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
yes
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Alternatively, we could set up something persistent, akin to the GUM's Minecraft server.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
What do you wish to add?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True, we could so it fits everyone's times.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
i would Suggest for future gamenights, we do Garry's Mod
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I second, Garry's mod is fun
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is partially present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Honestly, I would have to disagree with that due to some members not having it.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
hence why i said future gamenights.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Indeed; I would imagine most of us don't have it, but that's similar to most other paid-for games, I'd imagine.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Maybe specifically a time where people who want to do Garry's Mod, and that's all.
Also make sure to follow decorum.
Deleted User: 
We could do a CA SMP. In no way related to the Dream SMP.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I suggest Hoi4.
It is a great game
Tons of fun.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hoi4?
Deleted User: 
Hearts of Iron 4
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A CA minecraft server would be very interesting actually.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Hearts of Iron 4
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
IMO hoi4 can be tricky for those to learn, not to mention at minimum it's 40 or so bucks
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
it is pretty expensive to buy though
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It's a war game.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
HOI4 is currently on sale on humble bundle for $1.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Is it like Risk?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
yes, a CA MC server would be a good idea.
Deleted User: 
It’s basically a game where you become a country and fight other countries.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The entire point of hosting Jackbox and Gartic Phone for the games evening was because they're free and accessible games for all.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If you buy it at the right time it can be cheap.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The problem is HOI4 is $40.
Deleted User: 
I’m 99% sure a lot of us have Minecraft.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
HOI4 would be an issue for those without the funds/hardware.
Deleted User: 
I have Java, anyone else have that version?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
<div class="quote">HOI4 is currently on sale on humble bundle for $1.</div>
Deleted User: 
Woah I can afford it!
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
... What does SMP stand for again?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Survival multiplayer.
Deleted User: 
Survival multiplayer.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
A dollar is very cheap for a game.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Ahh. That could definitely work.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Especially one as great as Hoi4.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, HOI4 is achievable.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I meant the Minecraft.
Deleted User: 
I could build a Minecraft castle.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I could do something akin to my megaprojects on the GUM server.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think I mentioned this already, but I have an actual server computer and am willing to host any game servers we want for as long as we want.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Minecraft isn't exactly cheap either.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We could do that.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I'm sure basically everyone here has Minecraft.
Deleted User: 
Those who are logical have Minecraft.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
It's thirty dollars, but many members here already have it.
And those who don't can easily borrow the amount required from relatives.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
And it doesn't have to persist to game nights, it could be a side project.
Does anyone wish to add anything else?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
True, minecraft worlds should probably last longer than one night
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There would be one more question for a minecraft server.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Hence my suggestion for something persistent.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Bedrock or Java? A cross-play server would be best in my opinion.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I can get free servers for like an hour.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Bedrock is extremely hard to mod, while Java gives that option, ranging from anti-griefing to convenience mods.

Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I have both editions.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I do.
Deleted User: 
Same.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I do, and I would assume most delegates would as well if they do have Minecraft
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That's good for an extra option, but I can host them for free indefinitely
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I have both.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
You can?
Do you host it yourself?
Deleted User: 
I have Java and Windows 10 edition so either bedrock and or java would work.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
<div class="quote">I think I mentioned this already, but I have an actual server computer and am willing to host any game servers we want for as long as we want.</div>
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Ohhh.
Deleted User: 
Well this is great, isn’t it?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I currently host Skyrim Together, Terraria, Minecraft and CS:GO servers
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright let's set that up then, that's amazing.
Deleted User: 
CS:GO? DM me the server name.
Deleted User: 
I’m hyped. We could even make a channel for a gallery of things that people have built on the server.
That’d be a cool way to show off the server.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
It can be a cornerstone of the alliance.
Anyways, this strayed away from game night.
Does anyone wish to add anything else pertaining to game night?
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Nothing new from me.
Deleted User: 
I don’t care, let’s talk about this Minecraft server! (For legal reasons, this is a joke.)
Deleted User: 
Nothing from me, game night is very fun.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright we now have a discussion to changes to a election legislation.
Can you fill us in on this?
If Logan doesn't respond in 1-2 minutes we'll move on.
Deleted User: 
Oskonia is no longer present, thank you for having me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Dhrub and I are nearly done with our proposal for election legislation.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
You have a proposal for legislation?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes we've been working on it during the campaign hiatus this week.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Essentially we'll need to consider updates to the current legislation based on the events of this election, such as nomination times.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well, the election definitely needs to be pushed back.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Should we add a week?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I would be fine with that.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The time period between the election and the conclusion of my term is too close as it is.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Or however long the hiatus is we push it back via that.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
1 week, it concludes tomorrow (Monday)
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Logan's term would also be extended by that time right?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I don’t think this necessary. All candidates have pledged to campaign fairly. I don’t think it’s a good idea for candidates proposing their own regulations.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Proposals should be produced by non-partisan delegates ideally.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
If the elections need to be postponed for a week due to recent and rather extraordinary events, I would not be opposed.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Any proposals should be under the same scrutiny as any other legislation, regardless of who proposes them.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I am not opposed either.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What are the processes for pushing back the election?
Just pushing it back without any formal processes would just further damage the current base.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I don’t believe there are any, which is my main concern.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
A legislative act that should not be repeated in the future should do.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, it's a way to try to salvage this election.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There has been so much seemingly impromptu changes to this election that I am not in favor of adding to it without thorough legal processes and reasoning.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
And also to ensure that this campaign season isn't repeated in the future.
Which is arguably more important
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
The past month has been disgraceful to say the least.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Very much agreed, hence the only way to do this is through legislative action that shall not be repeated under future rules.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I can live with that, if it proves necessary.
What is the current reasoning for pushing it back?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I agree. Postponing would be making a further mockery of the election.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Campaign hiatuses, and to allow more campaigners to try to join.
Does anyone wish to add anything else before we move on.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't believe thats a valid reason.
The hiatus is about to end, and we have two new campaigns.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's just what people are thinking of.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I agree. Postponing would be making a further mockery of the election.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Is it people or a loud minority?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Minority probably.
I don't care either way.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Then we shouldn't further damage the integrity of the election.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I would say the majority are disappointed in the whole process.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
That is, in the general sequence of events thus far.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Sure, so we should cut out loses and let the people speak without trying to spearhead in a reason for more candidates to show up.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This is a poor attitude to have. This is rather an important topic.
Deleted User: 
Oskonia is once again present.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
The removal of a bar for registry for new campaigns might have been the best way to address the issue.
Now, at least, we have revitalized campaigns, as well as options for otherwise-disaffected voters to choose.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The thing is, if it was postponed it wouldn't affect me at all.
We would mainly need a vote on it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I do not support pushing it back at all. I don't see a good enough reason.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I very much agree.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
If the majority says to push it back so be it. Does anyone wish to add anything else before we move on?
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I would thus be in favor of more relaxed rules on campaign registry and changes to prevent future travesties from being impossible for campaigns -- or this organization at-large -- to correct.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I think we definitely need to look at regulation after this election.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I do not believe the election should be postponed, though I do believe there should be less restrictions and regulations on campaign regulations while there still is time.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I wouldn't be opposed to that.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
How are the current rules too strict?
Was it the window for signing up issue?
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
The Hamilton campaign was badly torpedoed from its inability to remove a problematic LT Chair candidate.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I think he means in reference to candidates wanting to change running mates.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
The signing up issue further exacerbated this problem. Both of the then-candidates then refusing to campaign nearly drove a nail into the entire election's collective coffin.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Alright, I can see that as a fair thing to change.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Indeed. It should really be open until the voting period.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Deleted User: 
Hahu.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
A refusal to campaign is a brutal way of describing the complex issue. The main cause for the hiatus was so the campaigners could have time to draft election reform. They were asked to do so.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
In short, a simple change in the bylaws regarding campaign registry could easily have averted the crisis before it became one.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Yet a refusal to campaign was exactly what effectively happened, and the motion to draft new legislation by both campaigns only came after an extremely negative backlash.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I 100% concur. I don't see how specific signing up to campaign came about inside this alliance.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Even if that isn't entirely the case, it looks exactly like events went down that way.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
It was.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Changes in registration also give the ability to remove campaigns (or specific members of such) for sorely problematic behavior without jeopardizing the election process.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, it would be less of a embarrassment.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What kind of behavior are we talking about?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Like James.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I agree, but still feel we should work on this legislation after this election rather than postpone the current election.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
But when they say removing campaigns, I wouldn't guess it would be the campaigns removing themselves.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Well perhaps suspending candidates that break the rules.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Like ones that insult other campaigns?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
That's politics unfortunately
And how would we define insulting
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Less of a debate and more of a scuffle.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't like the idea of suspending people for vague things that aren't clear laws.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
No, like campaigns that submit fake complaints about other candidates.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Like damaging reputations, name-calling and such.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That could also work.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There's a good reason that slander is hard to define when talking about public figures.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That could fall under the definition of a smear campaign which is definable
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It should be the responsibility of the voters to see through it, not of a potentially biased court to enforce.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This legislation would need to be approved by the members here. And all would have their day.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Indeed.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't get your point.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Defamation essentially?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah but this is micronations and not actual nations. We can see what's wrong more clearly.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
That, and submitting fake complaints against the other campaign to damage its reputation should definitely have resulted in a suspension.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It doesn't mean we should act as less. And it doesn't mean that it couldn't be exploited.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I am present
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I can get behind fake complaints.
The rest, I can't at this time.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This unfortunately this makes court rulings a popularity contest.
Deleted User: 
Well that one was targeted at me.
I don’t care though, do whatever you want.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, and i'm not saying we should act as less, but more of us know eachother than we would actually know like a president for example.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That's why I can't support it, its a great idea but it isn't workable like this.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
You weren't the first, and likely won't be the last. So it was targeted at future incidents. You've already been dragged enough for it.
Deleted User: 
Hahu, hahu.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This is all planning for no embarrassments <strong>in the future.</strong> We already disgraced this election.
Deleted User: 
I just want this election over with and new electoral policies made. We all agree that this election has made the CA a cesspool.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
How did it even get to this point?
Deleted User: 
At this point I don’t even know.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Let’s not dwell on the past. Let’s move forward.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It's not dwelling, we will need to review in order to not repeat it.
Deleted User: 
Hear hear. We need to take a look at our past and improve in order to move forward.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, if we don't look back it's bound to repeat.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Indeed we will, but that will need to be done when drafting the legislation. Constantly dwelling on the past in sessions is not really necessary.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Does anyone wish to add anything else?
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Indeed. And I also agree that legislation for this election is far too late. Anything would have to take effect for the next cycle, with the sole exception of enshrining new registry rules to set (hopefully) better precedents.
Nothing else from me on that matter.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, moving on.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
That said, I'd like to ask an aside on the date for Stormhold's membership vote?
I would like to be in attendance, if at all possible.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would like to apologise for the voting, as the bot appears to have been unavailable when I was trying to put the Observers up for vote earlier today.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Polling bot seems to be down.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Hopefully it will come back soon.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes it's offline
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It is in fruition though.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Thank you.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Now we have the CA Song Exchange.
<div class="quote">I was just wondering if there's enough interest to make this a weekly thing.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Stormhold is no longer present. Thank you all for a productive discussion with us.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That is what Mr. Martin stated last session.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I support the idea
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I support it also.

Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I support it
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
While I have not participated, I believe the suggestion by Mr. Martin to be a good one.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Same.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I am in support.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Seems like a fine thing.
Deleted User: 
I also support it. I contributed a song to the first song swap and it was so much fun getting to know others’ tastes.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Next, Jayden L. wished to add something. Might it be in the best interests of the alliance to appoint a Chief Herald for the North Lincolnshire project and the Herald shall operate a website on the cupertinoalliance.ca project that will allow people to host their images, with blazons and descriptions and all of that stuff
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
What would be the exact responsibilities of the Herald?
Deleted User: 
Don’t you mean Jayden D? As in Jayden Dagsa, delegate from Novus Hierosolymis?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Jayden Lycon, I assume
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Based on what he stated, I think moderate a website link to cupertinoalliance.ca that allows people to host images they wish to share, a gallery of sorts.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Jayden Lycon.
Deleted User: 
Oh.
Well ok then.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I wouldn't be opposed to this, it would bring more traffic to the website.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Oh, would this be part of the good picture project. Sorry, I am poor with the names of the projects.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I see the usefulness of a Chief Herald, but couldn't the Minister of Technology manage the website portion of this?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No it's alright. It was vague to me too.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This is very true. Soon every member will be picking up a role.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, I agree.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The North Lincolnshire project should have a leader though, to ensure the project does not fall inactive.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It already had to be revived once.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
The Chair?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
So appointing a Chief Herald would help I assume.
Does anyone wish to add anything else before moving on to membership?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
None from me
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

For the Soyuzist republic
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I apologise for the fact that we are 1 hour behind, as I had to deal with a few things.
Anybody wish to add anything before we begin?
I presume not, so we shall begin.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
First off I have received numerous complaints from delegates suggesting to remove Leon Montan from his position as Minister of Membership Attainment. Although I have stated that it wouldn't make a huge amount of sense to remove a minister with only 2 weeks left, the number of complaints has led me to put it on tonights agenda for discussion.
The floor is open to discussion.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I agree that it's a little late to take action.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Indeed
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Since there is only 2 weeks left.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
As do I.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
But what does it matter if the removal is accelerated?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I must add that I take responsibility for the lack of remarks, as I have consistently forgot to ask him at a reasonable date.
Deleted User: 
I was also thinking about Montan's removal. Although it is late, I feel that it is reasonable.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Since there is only 2 weeks left.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
It seems perfectly sane to accelerate Montans removal.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Agreed. We could still have applicants before the next chairmanship and it's important they get the best chance.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If this goes to a vote I will be abstaining as honestly I don't see the point as it is so late into the term.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I shall abstain as well.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I will be in support
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I do take responsibility for this proposal's timing as it is my fault.
Anybody wish to add anything further before we move on then?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then moving swiftly on.
Next up we have the confirmation of Jayden Dagsa as Deputy Minister of Asian &amp; Oceanic Affairs.
This isn't strictly necessary, however I would like to ask delegates how they feel about the appointment and if there are any objections.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
No objections from me.
Deleted User: 
I will be strongly supporting his confirmation as the Deputy. He has worked so hard on this alliance and he deserves it.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I support it.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I support his confirmation as Deputy Minister.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Not on my side.
I will abstain

There isn't a vote.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I know.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall move on.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
By abstaining I mean I can neither support nor go against it.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I personally am fine with the appointment.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Finally I would like to propose the implementation of an GUM-like Observer position for applicants.
Something that has always confused me is the lack of a more permanent observer position for applicants, which is commonly found in almost every organisation.
Therefore I would like to propose the establishment of an Observer position in addition to the withstanding one, which would be renamed.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I see no issue with such a position. I'm not sure that many states would spring for that role but I support its addition to the alliance.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I concurr.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I will be writing a formal act for this for tomorrow's session.
The floor is open to discussion.
<div class="quote">I see no issue with such a position. I'm not sure that many states would spring for that role but I support its addition to the alliance.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Could we add an option after the 2 weeks of initial observership, to just let them extend it for 2 or 3 months at a time.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Perhaps we could provide them with access to some services such as the Lincolnshire project?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I disagree with that.
Programs are for members and should stay that way in my opinion.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Agreed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Could we add an option after the 2 weeks of initial observership, to just let them extend it for 2 or 3 months at a time.

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from me.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I'm not sure how I feel about giving them access to some programs.
I feel like they should primarily be meant for members, but also we can't have the observer position be pointless if nations are supposed to hold it for several months.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Fair enough.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I suppose we would have to think about what benefits it would have, otherwise it wouldn't be overly used.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If it is a project that provides additional support to applicant states, then I would support it.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If we give them access to programs it lessens the need for full membership.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Then we could direct applicants that do not make the cut for full membership towards observership.
I wouldn't support any other projects though.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
First of all, observers should be able to observe sessions, but not vote.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
So would we be rejecting nations still then or just offering them observership?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That is how it already functions, but if they are meant to be observers for extended periods of time, if not indefinitely, then it should have more of a point.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">First of all, observers should be able to observe sessions, but not vote.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would say that we could devote time to developing observers to a point of full membership if we are having observers be those who don't meet the criteria for full membership, but I am not sure what programs we have or resources we would have to devote to such a system.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Oh, I did not know that. Sorry.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The time I spent in the GUM being an observer delegate for another nation, observe was all we did. I feel like it should be more than that in at least some fashion but I am not sure what at this time since it is effectively a balancing act.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We can't give them too much and lessen the need for full membership, but it also shouldn't be a redundant position.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Usually, less developed nations apply for observship right? What if we had a special program that focuses on developing observer nations?
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

<div class="quote">Usually, less developed nations apply for observship right? What if we had a special program that focuses on developing observer nations?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
All nations apply for the same kind of membership, observership is currently the first step per say.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There's no special way to apply for just observership currently.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't have anything more, but I encourage everyone to think of systems for observers to use to make sure the position has a good point.
I'll be doing the same obviously, not just passing it off on everyone else.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then moving on.

I believe that they were formally members before being expelled.
Their leader was underaged at the time as well.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Was that the reason for them being expelled?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I don't believe so.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What was the reason for their expelling?
They seem professional from what I can see in their wiki
But their discord is quite small
Was there something going on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
According to the vote to expel them they were inactive.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Oh.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Apparently they never even attended a session.
It's a no from me.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
If they are trying to rejoin I believe we should allow them in as an observer first.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Their isn't much to go on based off their microwiki page alone.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
To see if they can try and be active.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Everyone is an observer first.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
They seem fairly friendly, but their record would make me abstain.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Oh.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I think their leader might still be under-aged.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would be abstaining, or opposing.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I will abstain then.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anyone have anything else to add?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There just isn't much for me to judge them on with what is given by them, I will most likely abstain.

Nothing from me.

Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Their only claims are in the US and Dorset.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
They have maps (labeled outdated) of just some sort of suburb.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Actually I think that Potato Land claims Antarctica.

Hello everyone and welcome to the 114th session of the Cupertino Alliance.
Here is our agenda for today.

The 114th session is a American Session scheduled to be hosted on 31 July 2...</div>
So now let's get started.
So first on our agenda is on Replacement of Leon Montan as Minister of Membership Attainment.
As stated by the Chair last session. 
Basically what we are discussing is whether or not we support the replacement, and if you support it how are we going to act on it.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The floor is open for discussion.
I honestly don't support it.
I may of have a bit of personal bias, but seeing how the Chair's candidacy is almost up it makes no sense to go through the process.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I don’t support this motion. If we were earlier into the Chair’s term, I would absolutely support this, but with 2 weeks left until the next administration, I don’t see the point.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I do support the removal of Leon Montan. He publicly said in the New Virginia server that he no longer likes the Alliance, calling it 'Toxic', 'odd' and 'collapsing'. I do not believe, even if for only 2 weeks, a Minister who is not dedicated to our Alliance, should serve.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True but only for 2 weeks. He is the Minister of Membership, so I doubt he's going to get much work to do, where he could potentially do it lazily.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What does the Minister of Membership do, that someone else doesnt?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
All he does is look over a application and write a paragraph on the nation applying.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I am just worried for the already damaged reputation of the Alliance. If word got out the CA had a serving Minister who hated the alliance, it wouldnt go very well.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I may of have a bit of personal bias, but seeing how the Chair's candidacy is almost up it makes no sense to go through the process.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True, but I think it may become even more of an outrage to remove him just 2 weeks beforehand.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I am just worried for the already damaged reputation of the Alliance. If word got out the CA had a serving Minister who hated the alliance, it wouldnt go very well.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I suppose. Isn't the cabinet the decision of the Chair?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
That's why when the new Chair's come in they can replace Leon.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
I support the removal of Leon Montan.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
And have their own cabinet plan.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If I had proposed this a lot sooner then it would have been less of an issue.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
And when it's all said and done the process is about a week.
Does anyone wish to add anything else before moving on?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright moving on.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Nothing from me as well.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Next we have the Appointment of Jayden Dagsa as Deputy Minister of Asian &amp; Oceanic Affairs.
Due to Hamilton stepping down as the Minister, Dhrub was promoted to the Minister of Asian &amp; Oceanic Affairs, and he has appointed Jayden Dagsa.
Basically all we want is opinions on this Appointment.
The floor is open for discussion.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I have no real opinion on this. He seems capable enough.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I personally support the appointment.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
I don't support it.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What country is Jayden from?
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Philippines I think.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Hm. I suppose I have no reason to object. I hope he serves me well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would support this measure.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava:

I support it also.
It seems like what a organization would normally have.

Yes.

It can use a bit of cleaning.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I must apologise for the lack of a new agenda for today, as I am not currently available to produce a new one.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Atiera is intermittently present.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
First on our agenda is on the replacement of Leon Montan as the Minister of Membership Attainment.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will send once again our Chair's thoughts on the matter:
Floor is open for discussion.
Sander I - Revalia: 
May I?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
On the one hand, I'd say that this must be done as he's presided over the worst inactivity the Ministry of Membership Attainment has ever seen.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wholeheartedly agree with this motion. This should have happened months ago– why it never happened, I don't know.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Go ahead.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
In hindsight, I should have done something much earlier so I take full responsibility.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I think it's pointless to remove him now, as the removal should have happened a lot earlier.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would support the removal of Mr. Montan. Even if we are at the end and it is just left vacant, I’d rather see it empty than let the CA look like we don’t care.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">If Mr. Montan is removed from his position now, I would like to put myself forward for the position, as I'd likely get a headstart on the policy I wrote in <span class="mention">#campaign</span>.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would be in support of that.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
A lot can happen in two weeks. Why would we continue going on this way when we know it’s an issue?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I personally will most likely abstain on the vote.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Letting an issue remain is apathy, we shouldn’t be complacent, I would support Mr. Hamilton taking up the reigns.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Do any other delegates have any other things to say on the topic at hand?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
None, except to say that the delegate from Northwood-Oregon is completely correct.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think we should move on.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Agreed
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May this be an urgent motion?
This has stifled the alliance and several prior sessions due to the lack of remarks.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This is the final discussion period regardless.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I shall move on to the next thing on our agenda.
Next on the agenda is the appointment of Jayden Dagsa as the Deputy Minister of Asian and Oceanic Affairs. As I am the aforementioned, I will stay silent and let the delegates speak.
Floor is open for discussion.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I support it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Isn’t he already?
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Stormhold is present, although intermittently.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What is there to discuss? This has already happened.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
He is, although confirmation by the CA Parliament is just a formality.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, well I support it at least.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Ah, I support his confirmation then.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Legally, he can become the minister without Parliamentary approval, but this is a more democratic method, I suppose.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
As I said in the last session, he seems capable enough. I have no opposition.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That said, I fully support Mr. Dagsa for this position.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I suppose we get a look at how he would perform with this session, and it seems he would perform well.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Do any other delegates have anything else to say on the appointment?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Nothing further here.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I shall move on.
Next on the agenda is the establishment of new Observer state position.
I shall get the Chair's thoughts from the last session.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This ironically came up as I was typing a similar policy for the election. As such, I support this.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
<div class="quote">Finally I would like to propose the implementation of an GUM-like Observer position for applicants.
Sander I - Revalia: 
May I?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Hold on, let me get what I wrote.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Go ahead.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I'd like to say I am in support of the matter.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
<div class="quote">As it currently stands, the position of ‘Observer’ has effectively become a waiting role before delegates are eligible to become full members. We plan to create a ‘Provisional Member’ position for these waiting members, similar to the GUM, and focus on shifting the position of Observer to a more permanent position for newer member states that hold potential, but still require more development before becoming full members.</div>
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
As I had stated in a previous session, I hope to hear what we would provide to observers as opposed to members. I support the position, but it must be worthwhile for people to have in order for it to be properly utilized.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
What would differentiate observers from these proposed provisional members?
Longevity aside.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I said in the last session that I support this, and I still do to an extent, but the organization as a whole has a tendency to wish to become “GUM-lite,” and I think care should be taken to not do that.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The last idea I heard was giving observers access to some CA programs. But that is a difficult balancing act, like it all would be.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur. My time in the GUM as an observer delegate was just observing, not much room to be involved, we should ensure our observer program isn’t like that.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is partially present
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Regarding the GUM-lite notion, I heavily agree with keeping in mind avoiding that. We need to remember that at heart, we are supposed to be a development organisation.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I also concur.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur as well.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Would we be providing development opportunities to observers?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Observership would generally be granted to a nation that, while holding potential, requires more time and development before being offered full membership.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Concured
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This could definitely be arranged.
And I think it should be.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Why would you need development to join a development organisation?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think nations must come a certain way as to ensure our help wouldn’t be wasted.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Like.. obviously there is a line where it is plain ridiculous, but it is a rather baffling qualifier given our intention.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Hear hear.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
You and I both know that this organisation is hardly a development organisation these days, what with the development projects being abandoned.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Alas, that's not my jurisdiction.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think having observers will help that line. Nations that are more developed should be members that help enact the changes and developments, observers are those that we are trying to get to that level.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That should be fixed by whoever is in the next administration. I would rather not continue down this path of quantity over quality.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There are tiers to warrant our help, but there is a current lack of tiers at the moment.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This is a valid point.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There is only
With this system I hope that would change.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra will no longer be present, through me at least.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This plan is a great step towards that.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Do any other delegates have anything to say on the topic at hand?
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Nothing more from me.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Nothing further at this time.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis:

Floor is open for discussion.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Who are the members they are referring to in the application?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Members of this Alliance, I suppose.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Wow, remarks completed. That's a surprise.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Also, I noticed this applicant removed some of the parts of the page that we took issue with in a previous session.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
As I stated in the last session, the microwiki page could use some work and I will most likely abstain on the vote.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will likely abstain as well.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There isn’t enough digestible information here for me to make a proper judgement. The remarks are nice, but in this case having more information on them would make this a lot easier.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will abstain on the matter.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I will abstain as well.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Abstaining.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Do any other delegates have anything to say on the applicant?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
None from I.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The editing of the microwiki page shows they are willing to change aspects, but I can’t look at this applicant through the guise of our hopeful new program, so I must abstain or vote no.
This applicant is a good example of one that could benefit from an extended observership while getting our help.
I hope they will reapply with a new system if rejected, there is potential.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Once again, do any other delegates have anything to say on the applicant?
I hear none.
And that is all on our agenda, we shall adjourn at 12:00AM UTC+8 unless any other delegates have anything else to propose.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to propose a motion.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Alright. Please propose your motion.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to propose something that potentially is divisive. I propose the return of the membership cap– grandfathering in our existing member states. This would allow us to provide more focus onto our member states, allowing them to benefit heavily from the organisation as demonstrated during what is arguably the golden age of the Cupertino Alliance in Spring/Summer 2020.
This would also provide a spur for removing Inactive members.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would be in favor of a rotating membership window instead of a cap. Such as members can be admitted for two months of a chair’s term and then the other four months are for internal development.
I think we should revisit this after membership reforms though, as those will definitely change the possibilities with the cap.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I'm more in favor of what Carson has proposed.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I am also in favour of Carson's idea.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I am completely opposed to such a preposterous idea. The membership cap is a relic of another era of the Cupertino Alliance. A younger, less experienced Alliance, which didn't have to worry about high membership numbers. I can think of far better ways to moderate inactivity within the CA, than to implement a system that would limit this very growth that we are striving for as an organisation.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Membership growth for the sake of growth has little benefit. I would rather the growth be what we can actually provide to our member states.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with the proposal from the Northwood-Oregon Delegate.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We really need to provide real development opportunities before we can warrant shutting down for development.
My idea is one for the future, I don’t think we are ready for it yet.
And the membership reforms preposed by Mr. Hamilton will open many new possibilities for addressing this issue.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
We do not need to bar other nations from joining this organization for our member states to grow
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I know that, but your plan still prevents growth and prevents other highly experienced nations from joining, however you want to put it.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Do any other delegates have anything else to say on the motion proposed?
ShayanSJ - Kranoya: 
Kranoya is Present
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
None from me, other than that once again, this idea will be nothing but a burden for the growth of the CA.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Many things need to change before we can justify either mine or Sertor’s idea.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to note that the idea presented by Snyder is also a viable path in my opinion, with regards to restarting our organisation's aim.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I shall add something else to the agenda, which is at the request of the Chair.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Indeed. We should not bar members based on an arbitrary number to be attained.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Do any delegates have anything else to say?
I hear none.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What is the agenda item being added?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The expulsion of New Rubix on grounds of inactivity.
Floor is open for discussion.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Yes. 
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Neither delegate for New Rubix has been seen for weeks. Their primary delegate has left. Their secondary delegate is radio silent. Let's expel them.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am in full support of expulsion.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It’s a shame, but I can’t offer an argument to not expel.
There’s not even a message from their delegate in this hall.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Do any delegates have anything else to say?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Nothing else here.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Alright, if no other delegate has something else to propose, we shall adjourn at 12:20 UTC+8.

Some delegates have proposed the hosting of another games evening in the 4 day period between the elections and the end of my term.

Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Floor is open for discussion.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Im currently on vacation, so I don’t know
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The only days that I can’t feasibly do are Wednesdays.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Ideally we'll do it on a Friday, however that might clash with the final European session.
Would delegates be in support of moving the European session to the Saturday then?
I'll presume so then.
I cede the floor.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Alright, if any other delegates have nothing to propose, we shall adjourn at 12:25AM UTC+8.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
That's three minutes time, for those not in UTC+8.

Also, why would this minister be elected? 
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
It does say urgent act at the bottom. I also question some of the writing choices. Like 1 month isn't very definite.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Personally I believe that a new document might be required to suit the modern day CA.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I would agree.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'll change it to a discussion on the agenda.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I wouldn’t be comfortable passing this act to establish such a thing.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Or just have the AD&amp;P ministry oversee it.
I agree with the honourable delegate from Northwood-Oregon.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Overall the actual document is rather poor and I'd support it more as a group/project than a ministry.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We should revisit this and not settle for it in its current state through this bill.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">We should revisit this and not settle for it in its current state through this bill.

Alright moving on.
regarding microcoin.
<div class="quote">It allows micronations to safely transact money
The floor is open to discussion.
Personally I am opposed to the idea of implementing an Alliance-wide currency.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Agreed.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
The only thing that would make me really support this project would be if there could be some kind of advanced handling of the currency. To make it easier to regulate. Otherwise it's just another crypto.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Frankly, I don't think this should happen. My first issue is about security, my second is about how every multi-micronational currency has failed, thirdly is that we have no real use for it. If we need an alliance-wide currency, there are perfectly fiat currencies to do that with.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
As far as I'm aware there is no trade whatsoever between alliance members.
There is virtually no need for a currency that applies to the entire Alliance.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
It seems interesting
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
But I do see this as a reason to not put so much energy into such a project.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Interesting sure, but I don’t know if it’s worth the investment.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm sure that all trade between members have been conducted with real-world currencies.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It looks interesting, but doesn't exactly fit the bill for the CA.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don’t have anything.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright moving on swiftly.
Next up we have the Campaign Behaviour Act.
<a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SLiFCUUL8684AtcViZfkLkjvKs9NKf64nfXC60UYfaI/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SLiFCUUL8684AtcViZfkLkjvKs9NKf64nfXC60UYfaI/edit?usp=sharing</a>

The floor is open to discussion.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think campaign behavior guidelines are important to a healthy campaign season, and seeing as something like this was specifically requested in the recent campaign poll, I think it should be discussed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It looks good to me.
I'd be in support of implementing it.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Agreed.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Indeed.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
I am in support.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
No.
Sander I - Revalia: 
No.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I believe that this is definitely a needed act ensuring that proper standards are upheld and a fair election is run.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright we shall move on.
Finally we have the downgrading of Nova Tromso to observer status for inactivity.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with the honourable Australis Delegate.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I support the downgrading.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Apparently the last time they were present in a session was in May, and their primary delegate is no longer on the server.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Unfortunately, it is needed.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
In that case I support the downgrading sadly.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Although it is always sad to see an inactive member be kicked, I believe that this is necessary.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I agree.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Especially an older member.
Anybody wish to add anything further?
Sander I - Revalia: 
Nothing from me.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright I'll give delegates until 19:32 UTC before we wrap up for this evening.
With no further proposals I hereby adjourn this session at 19:32 UTC.
Thank you to everyone who has attended this evening's session.

Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Unless anybody has anything they wish to add then we shall begin.
First off I would like to begin by announcing that the Games Evening will be pushed to tomorrow and the awards evening will be pushed forward to 10 August due to my lack of availability due to holidays.
I sincerely apologise for the inconveniences caused, however I was only made aware of this holiday this morning.
Anybody have any issues with these dates?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
No.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Humberlea is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Alright then we shall move on.
Next up we have the expulsion of Nova Tromso and New Rubix for inactivity.
The floor is open.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support their expulsions.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
As do I.
It is unfortunate to have to expel a nation that's been a member for so long though.
Deleted User: 
I show no mercy. Expel them.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As Minister of Membership Attainment, I nominated these nations for expulsion. As such, my opinion is that they must be expelled as their inactivity shows a clear disregard for the Alliance.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Furthermore, it could indicate that the nation itself has fallen into a state of inactivity.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
now.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Deleted User: 
Thank you, Mr. Speaker. Friends, it is an honor. Anyhow, continue discussion.
I will be absent for 2 minutes or so.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
No one has heard fron New Rubix in months, and the leader of Nova Tromso left the community.
Deleted User: 
We will move on as soon as I can open Discord on my computer.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Great start. Anyways, as mentioned, these two nations must be expelled.
No further comments.
Deleted User: 
Alright. I am now on my computer and we can move on. I also support their expulsion.
Would you like to speak more on this topic, seeing as you wrote this bill? <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SLiFCUUL8684AtcViZfkLkjvKs9NKf64nfXC60UYfaI/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1SLiFCUUL8684AtcViZfkLkjvKs9NKf64nfXC60UYfaI/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Hearing none from him, you are free to discuss.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This Act seems okay to me, although I am unsure about the section regarding Spying. I do not believe this belongs with the other prohibited items.
I think that the spying that this act seeks to protect against is just poor management of Google Docs.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Yes. It seems poorly written, but if the other members are ok with the act then so be it.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I would accept this act without the clause on spying.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Deleted User: 
Anything else before we move on?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The spying section can be expanded upon, probably in its own bill like the others suggest.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
A broader privacy act, perhaps.
Deleted User: 
Alright. We shall move on to the CAGA Act, written by Chandrachur Basu. You are free to discuss this bill. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaGnCwl7gia6qx5y_R1g9xc9PUJ6ItC6u_lzChpL1Wo/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1oaGnCwl7gia6qx5y_R1g9xc9PUJ6ItC6u_lzChpL1Wo/edit</a>

Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I do not agree with this. This would be meddling in the internal affairs of member state, which should be completely off the cards.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I still don't see why this couldn't be treated like any other project, run by the Ministry of AD&amp;P
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
How so?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The CAGA act is very outdated and poorly written however it's intended to provide discussion.
If we have a session next week then I'll probably write a new one.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This is even worse in terms of writing. Also, I am not sure it is necessary.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
This would be within the Alliance, not member states.
Deleted User: 
It seems as if we are crawling off topic here. Our discussion at the moment is on the CAGA bill.
Deleted User: 
I concur.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
But where would it end? What if another member tries to use it as a basis against another nation?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Once again, I am strongly voting against the CAGA Act. Just because games evenings have been popular does not mean we need a whole new division.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I apologise.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
This was written last year.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think we should revisit this topic at the end of the session as it seems more possible discussion has come up.
Deleted User: 
Alright. Do we have any further comments?
Deleted User: 
We shall.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I think it should be either a standing committee or just a project run by AD&amp;P
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I have nothing else on this except we should have a much better bill for such a project if we are going to have a bill at all.

Agreed.

Alright. Our final topic on the agenda tonight is the implementation of Microcoin. I personally have not heard much about this, but you are free to discuss.

Micronational cryptocurrency is a stupid idea in my opinion.

The first topic on our agenda is the implementation of Microcoin.
Floor is open for discussion.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I am strongly against this. As previously stated, a currency program in the CA turned out to be unsuccessful, and all-round useless.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Sander I - Revalia: 
I also concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
There's lack of industry for an economy
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Exactly
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur with the Honorable delegate from Australis.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
There's no need for currencies in (most) micronations anyway
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I disagree with the idea of MicroCoin.

I am opposed.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I must concur with the Honorable Speaker.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I have a question to ask.
Even observers can't propose bills, how can we allow a non-member to do so?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
This was a held up bill, and was never put to a vote, from what I know.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I imagine a member would have to propose the bill for them
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thanks for the clarification. But I will be opposed to the said bill.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I am also opposed.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think a gaming ministry of some kind could be beneficial and aid in delegates forming relationships, but I don't think this legislation does it well so I am opposed.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This was written during a time when Lowenia was a member and was later rejected 12 - 2
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Do any delegates have anything else to say on the proposed bill?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I suppose it would need to be republished / responsored by someone else
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That would make the most sense
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Then I would wonder why was it even in the agenda in the first place.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is no longer present.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis:

Sander I - Revalia:

I think we should move on.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I believe so.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The final topic on our agenda is the expulsion of Nova Tromso and New Rubix. The Minister of Membership Attainment has recommended their expulsion.
I am in full support.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
What is the reason for their expulsion?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Inactivity.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
They have not attended a session in a very long time.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As I was the one who requested their expulsions, I am in support of this.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would be supportive of the expulsion of the two nations. They have been really inactivity in this period.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Do any delegates have anything else to say on the proposed expulsion?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from me.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
That is all on our agenda.
Before we end I would like to give some time for delegates to give reports on any current events in their nations, so as to give updates to other observers and members.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
(Any other proposals?)
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Jared Barker was recently appointed to the Privy Council of Australis, not much else has happened in Australis
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I'm about to publish the summer 2021 edition of the New Athenian Newsletter. The last 4 months have been the most successful and busy trimester so far.  The spring edition was 5 pages and it's looking like this one will double that.

I would request Mr. Hamilton to speak on their proposal.
The floor is open.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Absolutely, hold on.
This has been written to facilitate the cabinet changes proposed in the Roy-Mullins manifesto, following the passage of this Act, the new administration will then be able to do its second round of cabinet appointments.
Furthermore it is an urgent act so it only needs one reading, and a one day vote.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I concur with the act and all justification had been provided for the abolition of some existing ministries.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am in full support.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As I wrote it, I am obviously in full support.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
My main issue with the act is that it does not show what mutiple new ministries do in the act which could be exploited in the future, aside from that it seems fine.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Exploited in the future? How would someone exploit the use of a ministry?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present. I am also in support.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I have no objections to the act.

Would you like to add something on the said amendments?

I am in full support.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I think they are fair amendments and I support them.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It also increases the functions and duties of the Safeguarding Officer.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Please note this is an urgent act as well.
Does anyone have any objections to the said amendment?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
None from me
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
None from me either.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
None from me, this looks good.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
None from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We shall move on.

Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I am fully in support of this act as it will reduce instances where the minister and deputy minister are unable to host a session.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It is to note that due to the Main Region Act, the Asia-Oceania ministry has ceased to exist and I host sessions related to the region. 
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Main Region Act*
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That definitely would be an issue.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
What the Minister of Membership Attainment said is the exact reason why I wrote this act.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I do have to point out one thing, this body sentence seems like its missing something 
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Not sure exactly what this entails.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Is it meant to say that there is always a possibility that the chair could be absent during the regional sessions he hosts?
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I abstain.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I believe so
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That is the only thing I noticed, otherwise I support it.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
It has been fixed.
It was written in a rush, so I do apologize for that error.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What do you mean by 2-3 permanent speakers?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
2-3 permanent session speakers
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Yes I know it says that but what does it mean?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I shall nominate individuals to host sessions on my behalf, especially for the Asia-Ocean sessions.
I may not be able to turn on some occasions and host sessions. I just do not want sessions to be cancelled due to lack of speakers.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
But then what does subarticle 1 mean? Do you appoint a one-time delegate speaker or do you appoint 2-3 permanent placeholder speakers?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think it could be both.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
It is both.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
But wouldn't their tasks overlap?
I don't get it I'm sorry.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It looks like the Chair can have 2-3 pre-defined people that he can call upon if he needs, and/or he can ask someone else to do it
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
It does seem to contract itself.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
They are just two ways to address the same issue.
They aren't meant to occur consecutively.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
But then why would you need to appoint another person temporarily if you have a predecided menu of 2-3 people to pick from.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Because if the whole point is to have people as backups and your backups aren't there you should have a fail safe.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
Actually, I oppose this act. I can see conflict in having 3 speakers considering they may be 2 who both want to be speaker of a session.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I get now that one can decide from both options but it seems a little odd nevertheless.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That's all the temporary person is, a fail safe.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with Delegate Miller.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
An order of priority would solve that issue.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Sort of a line of succession.
That could probably work.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Exactly. That way there aren't arguments.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I concur.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That's not necessary. If the chair can't host a session, he will do what ministers do and assign an individual to the session. If he's not available to do so, someone will just step in like we've done before.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think an order of priority would still be a decent idea.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
But with the three permanent options that becomes an issue as not all are impromptu.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It makes things more certain.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Well yes I think that works good as it is but catering to subarticle 2 I think we'd need a line of succession.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
So should we amend the act to include that the chair must place them in a line of succession?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Think of it in the way of this analogy. It's always better to prepare for a war than to let the war come to you and then prepare.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
To address the delegate of Wegmat's concerns, yes we should.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Either that or oppose the act and stick to the current system equal to subarticle 1.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This act is to address the issues already present with that system, though.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The order of the sections has been changed, the Chair must have invoked the first subsection before invoking the next. (I will add this.)
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I think that the changes being made to the act addresses the concerns.
Does anyone have anything else to add?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
No.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Not from here.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, we should move on. We shall now discuss on the nomination of the Superior Judge.
Through a Chair Order, I had earlier nominated Carson Snyder for the said position deeming it appropriate that they shall discharge such duties to the best of their ability.
I shall note that Carson Snyder did an extremely outstanding job prior to the Virtual Session working immensely on the treaty.
The floor is open for discussion.
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span>
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am in full support of the appointment.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I oppose into any new appointment.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Mr. Snyder has my full support for the position of Superior Judge.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Might I ask why?
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I see no reason to remove the delegate for  the position.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I do not understand what you mean by our delegate?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
With all due respect to the Superior Judge, he has been mostly inactive throughout his tenure as Superior Judge. Furthermore, he does not have a great amount of experience, and has instead let Jayden Lycon do most of the work.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I am pleased that Carson was chosen, they've proven themself to be extremely worthy and professional since joining the Alliance.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would suggest you change the pronouns.
But I have to agree with you at large.
Does someone have else have anything to add to the nomination?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Nothing from me.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur with Delegate Hamilton.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
Nothing more from me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I apologise for the lapse in thought.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Moving on, it is not a legal binding that ministerial appointees to be confirmed by the Parliament but more a tradition passed on by my predecessor.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Definite full support for that appointment.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I could not support his appointment more
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
They have enormously contributed to the alliance and especially to all tasks they were assigned. The new membership process after the long time inactive Ministerial job by Leon Montan is truly appreciating.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
He's doing amazingly well at the moment, I'm excited to see what the future holds.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I support the appointment.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I abstain to the appointment.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am in full support.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The amount of work already put in by him in the short amount of time has already immensely recovered the Membership attainment ministry after Mr. Montan's inactivity.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I need to agree with you.
Does someone have anything to add?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I do
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The floor is open.
You may add.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Sorry for being late
The Soyuzist Republic is present
If thats still possible of course
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Of course it is.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
It is.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
You can contribute to the discussions.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Aright
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I am opposed to this appointment. We all have priorities over Micronationalism, and school is starting soon for some.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I don't understand how priorities over Micronationalism, and school is starting soon for some is a reason to oppose Daniel Hamilton's appointment?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I support the appointment
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
How is that relevant to my confirmation?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
How is this relevant?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I support it as well
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I'm not sure how this relates to the appointment- your schedule isn't Hamilton's
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I'm afraid your statement doesn't quite make sense.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
If that was in regards to Leon Montan's removal from the said office, they were inactive for more than 5 months in Logan Ross' 6 month tenure.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur with Mr. Lycon.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Besides, if you wanted to raise an issue with it, why not have done it when I was appointed two weeks ago?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I think in his defence there that here and now is the specified time for people to express support or distain towards the appointment.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava is present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I believe we shall move on to the rest of the appointments.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I think Rhymer still wants to talk.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Im saying that leon was demoted for reasons out of hos control
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
No?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
He wasn't.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
You had 5 months and you forced the judicial department to do part of your work
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
That is the most ridiculous thing I have read in all day.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
This ain't now real life works
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I digress
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
He wasn't removed on such matter. And speaking of Leon's removal in the Ross administration makes no sense to discuss in Roy administration.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
He had consistently stated that he couldn't be bothered to do his own job.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
This is a new administration and the Charter provides me to nominate new ministers.
The Ross administration has ended. Even Daniel Hamilton lost his ministerial job for some time.
I shall propose all other appointees in a single list format and you all may put thoughts in the same format as per the delegates' name and designation.
The other appointees are:
Delegates please add to it.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
You have talked to me about an appointment, do I need to add it here?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Burdette - I believe it is important to give people a chance - I will be supporting this nomination, provided he does his job to a satisfactory standard.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
No.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe that the appointment you are talking about will only happen if the Cabinet Reorganization Act is passed.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I from an entirely professional point of view oppose the appointment of Mr. Burdette due to tendencies which I have observed involving inactivity in his several held offices over time.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
I also missunderstod the request, sorry <img loading="lazy" class="emoji " alt="😀" title="grinning" src="https://twemoji.maxcdn.com/2/svg/1f600.svg">
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Please refrain from using emojis.
This is the session hall.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I've worked with Burdette for some time- sure he may be a bit rusty in some areas but I have confidence that he'll learn and improve
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
While I personally would oppose Mr. Burdette's appointment, I am supporting it provided that he does his work.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Burdette has proved himself capable after he did every tasks well which I had entrusted him in the past. He has promised to prove himself and we never provided him opportunity to prove himself in this alliance.
I am someone who does not bear inactivity and in case he is inactive, I shall remove him at once.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I have no opinion on the appointment of Mr. Burdette. He seems professional, and as long as he does his job to his best capacity, that's all that matters.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
This is my opinion. I concur with the Chair.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
That seems positive, thank you for adding.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We should not judge a book by its cover. We should allow opportunities to him to prove himself.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
If he does do his work, then that is great. If not, then we can easily propose a Vote of No Confidence.
So I shall support it.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Taking both perspectives into consideration I will abstain from expressing support or disdain.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Should delegates wish to speak on the appointment of Mr. Gheorghe &amp; Mr. Martin?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I once again concur with Delegate Miller.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Just a little correction. Gheorghe is the surname of Mr. Gheorghe Stefan Marius.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
As previously stated, I fully support both of these nominations.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I fully support them as well
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Support
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I support them.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Ah, okay.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Support.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
It's a common misunderstanding, that is my fault for using the romanian name format. I will soon change my name to follow the english format.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I apologise.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I will be opposed to burdette
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't see that as a valid enough argument against.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Your statement implies that TOES is professional.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I abstain from the appointment.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
My argument lies in the name.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I will also abstain.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Rhymer are you being sarcastic in implying that he is wrong?
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
I also don't understand how comments on a group chat is a valid argument.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I believe that we should give Mr. Burdette a chance.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
It is a group chat. Who cares? I can find evidence that “The Fun Gang” sounds unprofessional
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Exactly, who cares? Why does this matter.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I think I’ve worded my opinions
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
In a way.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I will be abstaining
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
But did I imply that it is professional? You're dragging off-topic matters into this discussion. Please be quiet now.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I don't see calling an organization with a logo of an emoji with a foot in its mouth for unprofessional as very unjustified to be honest.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I think that last sentence was rather rude and uncalled for, but whatever
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Mr <span class="mention" style="color: rgb(233, 30, 99); background-color: rgba(233, 30, 99, 0.1);">@Chair of the Board</span>, can we please move on?

be encouraged to uphold decorum in the floor of the house.

The next is the discussion on membership attainment.

Abstain
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Mr. Chair, the original links and statements aren't necessary anymore.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Their land and total population claim is... dubious.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
All relevant information is now entailed within the updated remarks format.
Please see my Ministerial Review on this applicant:
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I shall abstain from the nation's application.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
<div class="quote">only 180 of these are aware of the existence of Northway
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Mr. Elson had informed me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
180 students of the school where the leader studies.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Just seemed like an odd demographic.
I can't track how many people know of Northwood-Oregon.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I will openly oppose their admittance based on the information I have of them.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Could you share the information you have?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I will most likely oppose their membership, mainly due to the claim size.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It should be wise if Mr. Miller chooses to provide more information.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
The land claim more feels like a small scale movement reather than a nation.
I would abstain.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
It is public already, I don't have any exclusive information. Maybe I phrased myself wrong.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does anyone have anything else to add?
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
None here.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I have nothing further.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I will be away for a couple of minutes.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
None
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We do not have anything else on the agenda. Delegates may submit national reports.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I do believe the session is about to end.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon recently dropped its claim over Navy Island, known locally as Osme, it was originally claimed as a memberstate but was dissolved months ago and made into a sovereign land claim. Now, due to it being out of reach and without local governance. We have dropped the claim.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Lundenwic signed a treaty with the Kingdom of Ebenthal on the 7th August 2021. Yesterday I met with the Emperor of Austenasia and the Emperor of Adammia. We signed a treaty with Austenasia and a memorandum with Adammia reaffirming our cordial relations. We discussed numerous topics during the meeting including intermicronational organisations and the United Kingdom sector. There will be a press release about our discussions later in the year once we have completed some work.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That is amazing. I am glad to learn that you've signed a treaty with Ebenthal.
Vishwamitra celebrated one year of bilateral relations with Aenopia, Yu-Xia, Lytera, Ferthroy and Ilairan and Polarianda.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Thank you. The recommendations from yourself and Oscar helped us approve their request.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am considering changing our claim to Mount Banahaw (which was considered during Novus Hierosolymis' application to this Alliance) to a mere ceremonial and cultural claim.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is considering claiming a small green which is about 30 metres from Waterside Park's main territory.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I was one who advised both parties and should be the same for Oscar.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
proposed a Vote of No Confidence, which resulted in PM <span class="mention" title="RooZa#2448">@Rory - Lurdentania</span> being removed from office, making Gladden the new PM of Australis, and shifting the balance of power in the nation to the Conservative Party. Following this, Rory McPhail resigned from the House of Commons and relinquished his Australissian citizenship.

It is supposed to be quite productive.
The first is the discussion on the nomination of Phillip J. Pillin and Charles Burgardt as Associate Judges.
In my opinion, as we look for the separation of the court from the cabinet, we are appointing non-ministers as AJs. Moreover, I have deemed the two to be those who can discharge their duties neutrally and to the best of their abilities.
I support their nomination.
The floor is open for discussion.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.

Alright, the next on agenda is the Appointment of Michael Shepard, Jayden Dagsa, Jayden Lycon and Sander Koff as Ministers.
I strongly support the appointment of all abovenamed delegates as ministers.

Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will stay away from this discussion due to a conflict of interest.

You both can support or comment the nomination of the other three excluding yourselves.

I know both of them quite well now, and I know that they'll be beneficial to the organization as deputy ministers.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am supportive of both appointments.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I support their appointments. Tucker is still learning and I am sure he will be able to gain a lot of knowledge.

Does anyone have anything to add?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Nothing from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The next is the discussion on the promotion of Pontunia and Berry Kingdom as full members.
I must inform the members that the charter provides that observer nations be discussed in one session prior to be put up for voting.
This system was quite discontinued in the previous administration, however, we shall be bringing it back until we amend the charter.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
No and no. Retain as observers.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I concur with the Australissian delegate.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I also concur.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I think that Pontunia may be fit to become a full member.
Does anyone have anything to comment?
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
I don't think Pontunia has reached the level yet where it should be a full member.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright.

From these claims that Northway has on population and territory, I won't be voting in favour.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
As will I.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Same for me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Any further comments?
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
I don't support this
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright. We do not have anything else on the agenda.
Daniel Hamilton – West Sayville: 
Australis hasn't got many new things going on at the moment, however the current party in power has a new logo
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis will undergo major changes on its six-month anniversary, which occurs on 23 August, which will include the first delegation of the royal prerogative to a body since the Parliamentary era. An honors list will most likely be issued also.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Atiera has laid fairly dormant lately, however yesterday, I resigned as Speaker of the House of Commons due to my inactivity in Parliament.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Best wishes to Novus Hierosolymis.
Alright. I shall be adjourning the session.

Max I - Englica: 
I think it’s a good idea to have an advisory council
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is Present
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Humberlea is present.
Hans-K. Volmerson - Revalia: 
The idea is good.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I agree. I think we should implement it soon
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
News Athens in present
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Any further opinions?
Max I - Englica: 
I think it will be a good thing because it will help advise the alliance ahead
It’s the way forward
Sander I - Revalia: 
I also support the act.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I have no real opinions on the Act.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
I'm on the fence about this. Given that a former chair, and a former Lt. Chair are both already in the Cabinet, it might give a certain power shift.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I concur with the delegate from Ponderosa Hills
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
But, on the other hand, it brings experience onto the table to help new Chairs and Deputies to get started.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
While the idea behind the Act is good, wouldn't it be easier for the Chair or other Alliance members to directly consult former Alliance leaders rather than establishing another government institution to do the same thing?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Max I - Englica: 
I disagree
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is present.
Max I - Englica: 
If there’s something in place, it’s more institutionalised and thus in my opinion better
It can be done formally
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
I'm concerned that the council would only focus on advising; if it doesn't possess actual authority, it may end up becoming an impractical addition to the CA's government.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The soyuzist republic is present.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Any further comments, or shall we move on?
Sander I - Revalia: 
I think we should move on.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Indeed.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Next is the confirmation of Matthew Xia as Deputy Minister of Statistical Affairs.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I support the appointment.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Also, Confirmation of Harrison Dosen Grunning as Deputy Minister of Development and Interstate Cooperation and Confirmation of Daniel Quintaro as Deputy Minister of American Affairs. The floor is open for discussion.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I support the appointment.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I support this appointment as well
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I personally support all three appointments.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm a bit surprised that Daniel Quintero was chosen, but he's certainly capable, and I support both confirmations.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I will not speak on my appointment as I have an apparent bias though
Sander I - Revalia: 
I do so as well.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Yu Xia has been quite profesional from all the sessions i've seen them participate in, so I support Matthew's appointment.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I support all appointments besides from mine though
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Would anyone like to add anything? Or shall we move on?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I support the appointments
Hans-K. Volmerson - Revalia: 
I have nothing to add.
Let's move on.

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I will not support full membership. I support observership for Northway, in order to encourage development, then later see if they're ready to move on.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Some of the remarks are concerning.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I concur. Their claimed population is surprising.
But I feel like giving them observership would help them develop.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Berry Empire present with bad connection.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
A claimed population of 300k?
Thats quite odd.
Hans-K. Volmerson - Revalia: 
The numbers are concerning.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I oppose.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe they claim a large portion of the English county of Essex.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I kind of agree with giving them observership. Maybe being here and seeing other micronations would bring them back to reality in regards to the population numbers and landclaims.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
In fact, their claim seems to include a decently large international airport.
Hans-K. Volmerson - Revalia: 
Also the unknown extent of foreign relations and an unactive communications channel?
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is int present
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Crime in Northway is mainly drug related, with county lines from London moving in to Southend-on-Sea and targeting children as young as 10. The Government has been working against these groups, asking people to watch out for signs of their friends having new stuff they can't afford, aren't as free at the weekend etc.
From their MicroWIki page.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
It looks like a fictional micronation claiming territory they can't control.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Also part of the Micronational Assembly.
Hans-K. Volmerson - Revalia: 
I like this.
Woland - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The Government here refers to the HM Government of the UK.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not great.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Indeed.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Might still give them a chance to see if this happens.
Highly unlikely though.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
almost every micronation ever has potential to become something great.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yes
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Alright. We do not have anything else on the agenda.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I have never stated a national report, what does that entail?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I think it's some general important news from your nation.
If there are any.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park Park is going to form a town council within the next week.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
We are preparing on establishing relations with the other villages nearby this december. We are also trying to document as much of the area as we can.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Snagov just made the flags of the constituent Republics official through a decree. We expect a general election to happen in early september.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Duchess Kaitlyn of the Duchy of Altissia recently went on regency, placing her sister in her place. Duchess-Regent (the title given to her by Kaitlyn) Jocelyn will take Kaitlyn's place in the Duchy of Altissia and the Royal Deluge until she returns.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
The Republic of Yu-Xia is continuing preparations for the Yu-Xian Cross Country Championships, currently organizing an in-person national championships for the month of September.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens hosted its first in-person diplomatic meeting yesterday with the CEBTT and exchanged goods.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I forgot to add that we recently discovered that the Mosque was built by i3sen, muslims whom held high devotions over their religion.
Sander I - Revalia: 
MP Tucker Gladden resigned, Monarchist Party appointed Michal Nowacki to fill the vacancy. Also Johannes Mattias Toome was appointed the Chancellor of Justice.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra has appointed a vice president of its Privy Council as well as lifted the PNG status on Mr. Basu.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Alright. We shall be adjourning the session.
Max I - Englica: 
I know it has ended but I oppose their membership, numbers are very unrealistic

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is Present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I honestly don’t have much of an opinion on this act.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
As I stated last time, I'm neutral on this. It has upsides and downsides which are pretty much equal.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Pontunia is Present
Phillip - Pibocip: 
While I think it is a good idea to ask those “who have done it before,” I fear that it may inflate bureaucracy
Rory - Lurdentania: 
This act, while still good, does create the problem of too much  bureaucracy.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
A future chair could easily just ignore such an advisory council.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I am neutral on the act as well.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Also, if one wants advice from previous alliance leaders, they should appointed them to cabinet positions.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Floriland is present
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I concur
Phillip - Pibocip: 
I feel like the point of the chair and the committee is to make the their own decisions
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It would almost certainly create an inequal power shift, plus it means keeping people who don't still have the public vote still quite high-up in the alliance.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I will stay neutral.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yeah it may be better to have chairs independently seek advice from their predecessors rather than have it be an official function.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
I concur.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Does anyone have any other opinions?
Phillip - Pibocip: 
I concur
Rory - Lurdentania: 
None from me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don’t have anything else.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Nor I
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Hearing none I will move on, give me a second to find the statement I prepared.
I would like to host an American Summit. The reason I am bringing it the floor in this session is to find out if there is anything in particular that you guys would like to see or any ideas you might have for it. I have already ran a poll and I have found out that Saturday at 4:30 PM EST would be ideal for most delegates. I know we want to have presentations from nation to show some culture or achievement or topic in micronationalism from there nation, we've also decided that a treaty would be cool the idea is that the treaty would try to bolster diplomacy between the nation I have a few ideas on how to do that but I'd like some feedback on the ideas or which ones you would like best: 
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I assume you mean American Summit right?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Oh yes my bad.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
On your first point of times, American sessions are more easily attended by myself, an Australian delegate, so I like this time.
Secondly I think both ideas are brilliant.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
No worries, personally I am not a big fan of the communal land idea but that mostly is due to my personal ideology surrounding land claims.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Would this be psychical or virtual summit.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Virtual.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Virtual.
America is such a large place.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Just making sure, thank you for answering.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
As an African, my timezone will most likely collide heavily. I will try to make it but I can't make much of a guarantee. As for option A and B, A sounds much more interesting.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The treaty recognizing each other would only be able to be signed during the summit right? It wouldn’t be open past then?
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
And with that treaty would someone have to pull out of it as a whole if they wanted to stop recognizing one nation specifically?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Yes that would be the idea although I'd be happy to keep it open for perhaps another 12 hour to give other people a chance if they want to sign and can't attend.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I only ask because the people signing may change depending on who else is signing. Especially if someone we didn’t want to recognize signs hours after Northwood-Oregon signed.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Maybe just promote the reason why diplomacy between member states is important and let the member states do the rest between themselves in private correspondence.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I haven't actually written it yet if you wanted though I could add a provision for that.
I'm still leaning more towards option 1 at the moment.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
That is a very good point.
What would option one achieve though?
A piece of land that dozens of people own and then forgotten about?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think that would be something valuable to add as to ensure one nation doesn’t spoil the whole thing, but at the same time it would kind of take away from the point so it’s a balancing act I suppose.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Option A seems interesting.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I think nations should individually sign treaties with one another as they please.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I mean if several nation share a piece of land it would regard at least some communication between the head of states that sign.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well they would sign the group one as they pleased as well I assumed.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We’d have to ensure all nations would be invested in the land then in order to make sure communication is necessary.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'd be interested, as long as that land is being actively maintained.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
That is a good point.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Is there an idea of what this land would be?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Would you like if I mapped it out and showed that next session?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yes, please.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Yes
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I was just asking for perspective of what kind of land it would be.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
it would be grassy with a lake connected.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Public?
Or private?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It would be public but easily controllable.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
OK
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Any other thoughts?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from me.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
None, I will wait till the next sessions.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Will there be a limit on who could participate with such a program?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
CA member states.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Anything past that? Like could both simulationist and successionist nations?
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Once claimed, does the land plan to be used for anything?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Yes both would be able to participate.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
And like the treaty could nations become part of it after the summit is over?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'd keep it open for 12 hours to let people who couldn't attend the session sign but after that no.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Alright I don’t have anything else.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I am in full support over the idea of an American Summit
I believe it to be a great idea and if successful should be implemented within other regions
Rory - Lurdentania: 
If America gets a summit does that mean Oceania will too?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I am planning to use it for the Burdette local section of out yearly chess tournament, if this works out.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I am not in control of the other Ministers but I'd encourage them to each hold one.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Understood, thank you for answering my question.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Now we will move on to promotion of Berry Empire and Englica as full members.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I am not in support of Englica's promotion.
They have only attended 1 session since becoming an observer.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is no longer present.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
There delegate does not seem very active so I will be neutral on this one.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The Berry Empire has also just had a shift in government, which is a little concerning.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I am neutral on them.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Technically that's all the charter asks of them.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
While that's true, they've shown a lack of effort.
They weren't even in the server when they became an observer.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
I've heard the Berry Empire wants to declare war on Kiribati, a Macronation they'll probably never be able to contact.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
From whom?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I will most likely be abstaining on the votes.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Who is their delegate?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park:

Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I am against their promotion, simply due to the lack of effort they have shown.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Berry kingdom seems fine to me unless other evidence to disprove that is shown.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What reason do they have for that?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
And I have never heard of Englica so I will abstain.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
They're an observer here.
John Lakes - Floriland: 
Someone called Loljh.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Berry kingdom has a discord server which is professional as well as a professional leader, which is why I will support their promotion.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I don't know who that is, so I have no idea about the truth to that claim.
But I'll give them the benefit of the doubt.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I personally support the entrance of the Berry Kingdom as a fellow member of the IAC

Aerospace Community
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
International Aerospace Committee, basically a group of micronations with aerospace programs
Several CA members are a part of the organization
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Oh interesting.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The IAC? Sounds very interesting. The SSA might apply soon
Rory - Lurdentania:

I will be against their application for now due to their past history

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
I shall make comment on a few topics momentarily, please bear with me.
Regarding the Advisory Council, I strongly oppose this idea. Such bodies prove to be superficial and ceremonial at best, and as proven with organisations such as the GUM– is wholly unneeded.
Regarding the American Summit, it seems redundant in its aims and goals. Rather than catering to the American Sector and its needs, it merely rehashes the previous Cupertino Alliance summit, alongside the addition of controversial elements such as communal land. If the summit cannot reasonably differentiate and distinguish itself, it seems wholly redundant and a waste of time that could he better spent on developing our member states.
Regarding Indradhanush, I support their application. Whilst they have a troubled history, at the end of the day they have promised to make amends and at the end of the day– they are only young.
I cede.

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I don't really see a need for this to be written into law, but I like the idea.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Through this bill, it is aimed to establish 28 January as the CA Day.
Similar in the fashion of UN Day
The floor is open for discussion.
Delegates may comment and speak on the bill.
Max I - Englica: 
I don’t see any reason to vote against
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I support this act.
Max I - Englica: 
I support this act too
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Do anyone anything else to comment?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from me.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
nothing from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, we shall move on.

The floor is open for discussion.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I've thought about it for a while now, and I'm against the act. It's almost certainly going to make an unfair power shift, and this doesn't need to be written into law.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Could you explain, what do you mean by power shift?
The bill does not say it would confer power to the council.
Max I - Englica: 
The Chairs/Lieutenants thing doesn’t go right with me
Sander I - Revalia: 
Revalia is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It means that people who are already in the Cabinet will continue to be higher up in the Cabinet for however long they please.
Max I - Englica: 
I think that there are veteran members who would be very good on the Advisory Council who haven’t
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
As an Advisory Council I have no problem, as long as said council doesn't then gain powers in the future.
Max I - Englica: 
I will also suggest another potential function
To advice members about there own Micronational issues
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The bill does not say it will confer any power to the council.
Ezri Ambriz: 
I do like the idea hence forth
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Furthermore, for now, former Chairs and Lt. Chairs are joining the cabinet but this may not be in the future as a compulsion.
Ezri Ambriz: 
Ah i see
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I am aware. I just don't want another bill in the future that would then give them any powers.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That could be opposed.
Any further comments?
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
None from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The next is the discussion on the revitalisation of the CAoNI project
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is back again, sorry about the absence.

I shall be glad if Mr. Martin speaks on the proposal.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Essentially, the proposal seeks to allow physical structures into the CAoNI project aswell.
Max I - Englica: 
I haven’t been here for too long, what is the CAoNI project
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Greetings!
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It is a project which seeks to protect and conserve natural areas in member states.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Oh, I run a project like that in my country
Ezri Ambriz: 
But wouldn’t that be expensive
And concerning to the public?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Unfortunately, many member states don't have many natural areas, which has led to inactivity.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
How so?
Max I - Englica: 
That is a good idea
I think conserving natural and historic areas is a good thing so we can preserve the world for future generations
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I doubt any micronation is going to build a realistic Great Wall of China that would distress the citizens.
Ezri Ambriz: 
Well, if the public is known about those physical structures, wouldn’t that be taken down or something around like that
Ezri Ambriz: 
Oh, now I understand what is this project is for
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
CAoNI isn't about creating new areas. It's about preserving already made ones.
Ezri Ambriz: 
Yes I see
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
In the proposed guidelines, it does state 'within jurisdiction'.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Ovrestlia is present
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Essentially, don't do stuff on others' land without permission.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would be supportive of the CAoNI program
Ezri Ambriz: 
Oskonia is present
Ezri Ambriz: 
Yes me too
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Me too, I run a project like that in my country either and with the help of the Army, we have prepared some areas ready to accept citizens, in case of a war or a natural disaster
It seems to be very helpful
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
Also someone might want to check the website, specifically the apply section
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Any further comments?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Still under construction. Also Daniel's supposed to be in charge of that page.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The MoD&amp;IC should be in charge.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
Yes, I could tell that. If you click on the apply drop down on the CAoNI page you'll see what I am referring to.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
What is MoD&amp;IC?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Minister of Development &amp; Interstate Cooperation.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Oh
Thanks
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
CAoNI falls best under that ministry.
And not Ministry of Membership Attainment.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The Apply section of the website refers to application for a nation into the Alliance.
This is getting off track.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It still falls under MoD&amp;IC. Jayden Dagsa &amp; Harrison Grunning be in-charge.
Any further comments?
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Berry Empire present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright. We may move on.
2021/08/F/002 - Indradhanush</div>
Membership Application Remarks  29 August 2021  Application Information  Name of Applicant: Kingdom of Indradhanush Name(s) of proposed delegate(s): Chandrachur Basu  Applied on: 27 August 2021 Application Number: 2021/08/F/002 CA Vote Code 2021/M/A/005  Basic Information  ...</div>
The nation has previously been a member state between August &amp; October 2020 as the Republic of Lowenia.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
They're applying to improve, Mr. Basu's conduct has greatly improved over the last month, too.
Ezri Ambriz: 
Well, I still rather call this quite odd
As I didn’t know that this would happened
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am someone who has faced a lot of stress from Basu, but since he was allowed back in Vishwamitra. I would be suggestive that he is given a chance.
Ezri Ambriz: 
Yes, I also had stress from Basu, from the situation on the beginning of this year, but I’ll maybe accept this, I don’t know to be honest how will this go if he is in the alliance
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does anyone have anything to comment on their application?
And also to note, they made this application on my suggestion.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I will abstain on that matter.
Ezri Ambriz: 
Is abstain mean mixed?
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
Abstain means you with to present no opinion either way.
Farhaz Hazarika - Huai Siao: 
Huai Siao is present
Ezri Ambriz: 
Well im just mixed to this basu guy
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I fear than many might be divided on Basu. But we may ask them to name someone else as primary delegate in case they are admitted.
Basu has also indicated a break from micronationalism next year (which is uncertain)
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I have nothing against Basu, and am willing to give him a chance.
Matthew Griffin - Vishwamitra: 
I am as well.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Any further comments?

Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Yu-Xia is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I like the idea.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
It's a pretty good idea.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I support the idea of a Cupertino Alliance Day to commemorate the revival of this organization.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I think it is a simple and understandable way of commemorating and appreciating the organization.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Snagov is present
Max I - Englica: 
Nothing really to disapprove of here
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It’s a nice and simple idea, I agree.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
We can also honour people who served the Alliance and delegates or the head of the State of the members, observers or nations which are pretty close to the CA can make statements.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
No, that's true, but thoughts and suggestions are always welcome.
Max I - Englica: 
In my opinion there is nothing to disapprove of
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Perhaps the chair would like to further present the case <span class="mention" title="Dhrub#6459">@Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra</span>
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I had initially planned to bring up a bill on declaring 1st April as CA Day, but after having a detailed chat with Jayden Lycon, one of the founding members, we decided to commemorate the day when the current form of the organization was established or the CA was revived.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is present.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
May I ask, why do you proposed 1st April as CA Day?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
CA was established on 1st April.
But then it was not as successful as the one after revival.
So, both me and Lycon felt that 28 January (date of revival) would be a better date.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Thank you for your response Mr. Chairman.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
My pleasure.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Seeing as the discussion regarding the proposal has largely died down and everybody seems to be on the same page we shall move on.
The next on the agenda would be on the revitalization of the CAoNI project.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I shall no longer be present for the session.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Noted
The floor is open.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
OK
I proposed this with a new set of guidelines which you can find at <a href="https://cupertinoalliance.com/caoni-proposal">https://cupertinoalliance.com/caoni-proposal</a>
Cupertino Alliance</div>
The official website for the Cupertino Alliance. Still under development.</div>
Essentially, the CAoNI project, in its current state, is about protecting natural areas. This proposal would allow man-made structures and areas into the project aswell to boost membership.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
This article of discussion comes up every few months. We try to revive it but it simply never kicks off. I simply don’t think this project has enough interest from delegates to warrant trying to revive over and over again.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
That's probably because nothing's ever been put to vote to fix it since its creation.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
For me it seems too that the project is more a subject of back and forth discussion rather than action. However this link looks interesting.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present.
For me CAoN I has been revitalized so much to the point where I think we should just drop it.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
As far as I can tell it's never officially been revitalised in this way.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Being a human who is interested with Ecology and environment stuff, it seems a pretty good idea, as each country can make good use of the areas with cultural expedients.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I am personally all for its implementation but is anyone willing to carry through with it?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
By this point we're going in circles with CAoNI.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It fell to inactivity around 3-4 times. We had discussions on it multiple times for revitalization I believe.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Bury it and focus on the twin towns project in my opinion.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We are wasting the alliances resources trying to focus on it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Simply put, nobody seems to have proposed allowing non-natural areas into the project while in session before.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If you could bring it back from the dead and turn it into a successful project then that would be fantastic but I'm not holding my breath.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
One thing is trying to focus on it, another thing is never actually doing so.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Do we have a dedicated team who will be working on it if changes are implemented?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
That's up to the Ministry of Development and Inter-State Co-operation to make a team and/or oversee the project.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Then will they?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
If this, after the votes have happened, succeeds, then they ideally would.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Ideally this would have been maintained awhile ago but we need to ensure people will take care of the project if we are going to try to fix it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If we're still on the topic of CAoNI, then I must add that the primarily reason for its inactivity was the lack of interest from members.
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I think part of the problem lies in the capacity of the ministry as well.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon would be more than willing to participate in it but management is a big thing too.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We tried in March and July to revitalize it, if we change it we need to change the program as a whole to fit member needs.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Which to my understanding is poor for the time being.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The Ministry of Environment and Geographical Information as it was called back then was quite inactive, which may have partially led to its detriment.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Indeed, I just want to be sure the new ministry will be active and take interest in the program so we don't keep implementing fixes without addressing the root cause.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Maybe it would be in our best interest to give the reformed ministry a chance?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
If they won't address it, I'll try to do something about it within my ability.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
I agree.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Agreed.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Maybe you can volunteer to supervise the project however that would be a decision for Mr. Dagsa to make.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
In my personal opinion, it would be better to have promised commitment before hand.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Also, why would we transfer the project to the Ministry of Environment and Geographical Information (after a revival of it)?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Instead of tossing it onto them and hoping.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
We won't, that ministry no longer exists.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Oh I see...
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
It's never too late though is it?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
When referring to this project, that is a commonly used statement.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Doesn't hurt to stimulate the ministry a little either now does it.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The Cabinet's history is a bit of a confusing mess, but the project would be overseen by the Ministry of Development and Interstate Co-operation.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Was it merged to the Ministry of Development and Inter-State Co-operation?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yes.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
If they can do something with it I assume they will, if they cannot they will not. Simple as?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I want to see it succeed but the parliament has given it more care than any minister has, it's not worth wasting parliament's time if the people in charge don't care, or if the member states don't care.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
What if we add to the project observers? It will boost membership too. (If it's that possible)
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What do you mean exactly?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
There's nothing against observers joining projects in the charter as far as I'm aware, I'll look into it to see if this is an option.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The ministry is in charge of creating hype around it is it not? You're not going to be engaged in something which its overseer doesn't care about. Giving the reformed ministry a chance would absolutely be optimal.
After that I guess we'll see what comes out of it.
But that is not our business.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Are these reforms needed to give it a chance? Do these changes need to be implemented for them to have started working on it?
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
I mean, if observers could join the project, CA would have a boost in membership and the project wouldn't be dead either.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There's no drumming up coming from the ministry, and to my knowledge we aren't disabling them from working on the program without these reforms being implemented.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
By reforms I mean the reformed ministry and not reformed project proposition.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I know. My point is that the reformed ministry doesn't need these reforms to start working.
And since they haven't started working, I question if they care.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Good evening gentleman. May I inquire as to where we are up to on the agenda?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
CAoNI's revitalisation.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Right.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
That should be scrapped outright.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
We are talking about CAoNI's revitalisation.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Sounds reasonable
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
CAoNI is at best, placing an A4 piece of paper on a tree. There is very little interest in the project, and it is better we focus our efforts on more popular projects.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The minister in question has already stated that he will be more inactive due to schooling and the like, as well. I don’t call his capability into question, but I doubt drumming up a project that the delegacy has shown time and time again they don’t care about is very high on his priority list.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Hear hear.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
That is what I was going on about. The hype regarding any project though is generated from the organizer's encouragement. I suggest Mr. Martin takes this up directly with the ministry instead of the parliament and we'll see how it works out.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to iterate that the relevant minister should have been the one to present such a motion– as has been brought up several times during the previous administration, we are seeing a continued pattern where the ministries are continually circumvented without prior consultation.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We should even consider asking alliance members if they want to see it continued, and if they’ll participate we if it does.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Maybe if the center of encouragement regarding the project is shifted to someone individually engaged this would change people's perception of the project as a proposition stuck in buerocratic limbo.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur. We shouldn’t be surprised when we hurl work at someone without warning and they don’t do it.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to note that I believe this is at least the third attempt at this projects revival. There is a demonstratively clear pattern of little to no interest, and thus nearly zero engagement from delegations.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Little interest from the ministry means little interest from the members almost as obviously as the fact that 1 + 1 = 2.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Hear hear. 
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The project was created by this parliament, and no one participated.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
This also goes the opposite way. If the members don’t have interest, why should the ministry?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
My point is that the project might see a brighter future under a more autonomous administration. Now this is just speculation but I believe it makes sense.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It had a majority vote to be created and how many times was it used by a member? Once maybe? 
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
My question is whether if it's the source of interest which fails or the public interest by itself.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
In my opinion, the Ministry should discuss about the future of the project. The opinions are divided in half. We are not going to have a final decision.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
This discussion has gone on for 30 minutes and I don’t see any new ideas or consensus nearing being reached. 
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The ministry apparently doesn't want to discuss about the future of the project and leaves it instead to the parliament.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Maybe we can discuss about the project after some statements of the Ministry?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I don’t see Division. There seems to be a clear consensus that–whether it be due to the ministry of because of the delegations at large– that this project is not worth our time and effort.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
I concur.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
We will move on if nobody has anything more to add.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Indeed
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Nothing further here.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The discussion has not been pointless and we use as much time as we need; but with less interest in continuing any further we shall move on.
The next point on the agenda is on the topic of promoting Ovrestlia to the status of full membership.
The floor is open.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Have they requested a promotion?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Unfortunately I do not have any reference points.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
I would not make any statement. Delegates should talk. But if I can answer any question, I would love it.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wish to pose the following: lacking the chairmans reference points, has the Ovrestlian delegation requested a motion to promote its membership status?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I see a problem in the lack of reference points here. I would refer to any remarks that might regard them but I can't find any.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
No it has not. There was a discussion with Mr. Chairman about that. I have applied and he mentioned me the promotion in today's agenda.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As a session speaker, you should be communicating with the cabinet in the session planning channel to clear this up. This was created following similar situations in the previous administration.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted. If a promotion motion has not been requested, then I believe that this discussion is pointless, as such a promotion would thus be a violation of the charter.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Mind you this is my first time hosting a session and I am not well acquainted with any practices or methods beyond the contents of the agenda provided to me.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I was beginning to question why their upgrade was being discussed for a moment.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Maybe Mr. Chairman can help us?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Without anything to refer to regarding the topic of the promotion of Ovrestlia, the floor will be closed and we will move on to the next topic. Any questions before we proceed?
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
He informed me about the promotion and I would never want to violate the rules of CA.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
This isn’t on you for the record, merely a bureaucratic oversight.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
I hope so...
Maybe you want to check my application?
I've done all the necessary applications
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The discussion has ended thank you.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Fine.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
With no further questions then we will be moving on to the next topic of the agenda which regards the third reading of the Kingdom of Indradhanush.

Refer to this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I am in support of giving them a chance, as they're clearly interested in improving their reputation.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I support the application of Indradhanush.
I believe they will benefit heavily from joining a development organisation.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I concur.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I support them as well.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Any further concerns?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
<span class="mention" style="color: rgb(228, 180, 0); background-color: rgba(228, 180, 0, 0.1);">@Observers</span> With no further concerns I suggest that we move on, those of you who have been present or wish to do so, I encourage that you take the opportunity as per the agenda provided to present any matter or concern of yours, be it general inquiries or alerting the parliament of legislative propositions.
(Unless I misinterpreted the agenda but I'm pretty sure I have not)
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Nothing from me.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I wish to open for national reports as well.
As per the chair's request beforehand.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Could the CA create a page listing all claims in the Antarctica?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Why?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe that is not a matter of the alliance, nor any ministries, nor any projects, nor any delegates.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
It's confusing, too many people claim the same place.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
As far as I know, no CA member state claims land in Antarctica.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
In my personal encouragement, just stay away from the poles as a whole.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Okay, just a suggestion.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Regarding national reports, today the Rashtradhyaksh and the Conference of Rulers have invoked article 50 of the constitution laying grounds for the dissolution of the constitutional monarchy of Basistha.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Soyuzist Republic has gained word that a large group of migrants have been spotted near the left of Adra setting up a small temporary camp
To make sure the first campaign works correctly we may have to interfere.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Should nobody else seek to report any matters to fellow delegates in due time, the 125th session will be adjourned at 20.15 UTC sharp.
The 125th session is adjourned - having lasted a good 1hr 15min. Please take any further discussion to alternative channels.

Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Very well. Before, we begin, I would like to take some time for us to remember the victims of the September 11th attack. I will now present the statement.
Thank you. As we stand today, on September 11th, we remember the 2192 civilians, 343 members of the New York Fire Department, the 23 members of the New York City Police Department, the 87 civilians on American Airlines Flight 11, the 60 civilians on United Airlines Flight 175, 59 civilians on American Airlines Flight 77, 39 civilians onboard United Airlines Flight 93, and the 125 working at the Pentagon that were tragically taken in of the greatest tragedies on American soil. All of these people had things in common: They all had mothers, fathers, parents, grandparents, brothers, sisters, siblings, friends and colleagues who mourn their death. Today, and everyday, we mourn with them and say: “Never Forget.” We ask all to take a moment and hold those taken and their loved one in your thoughts.
Thank you for your time. We will now move forward with the session.

Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Seems good.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm not sure how to feel about the idea of a Cupertino Day.
It seems slightly cheesy to me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It feels somewhat prideful to me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Nor am I. There's nothing inherently wrong about it, but it seems pointless to write it into law.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I agree.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I think it sounds good. It depends on what we would do with it, whether it’s holding an event or such.
Also, brief note, please correct me if I am not following the procedures of the session or Speaker.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I don't think it should be in the law.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It feels as if the Cupertino Alliance is getting treated by the Chair as a nation, not a alliance though.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I see your point.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It can be a unofficial celebration maybe?
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Definitely.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I concur.

I concur.

Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Very well. Seeing as there no further debate, we will move to the second matter of business.
The next order of business we have is a third reading of a motion for the Revitalization of the CAoNI project.
The floor is now open for debate.

If you haven't already read the proposal, or just need a refresher, you can find it at <a href="https://cupertinoalliance.com/caoni-proposal">https://cupertinoalliance.com/caoni-proposal</a>
Cupertino Alliance</div>
The official website for the Cupertino Alliance. Still under development.</div>
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Ah, thank you.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Simply put, the proposal seeks to allow man-made areas into CAoNI and to make sure that these areas are actually being conserved.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is present
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I think that would indeed help boost activity.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I know we spoke about it in a previous session so I have to ask if the ministry has given any update as to if they will be taking care of this project?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Some man made buildings have stood for a while, and allowing those into a preservation program could help maintain their legacy.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I don't believe so, as Mr. Dagsa is currently at school.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I concur. I support this motion.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
He finds time for other things. I have to ask if he just isn’t interested in this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Some man made buildings have stood for a while, and allowing those into a preservation program could help maintain their legacy.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
NB The proposal will rename it to the Cupertino Areas of National Interest.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Is it to preserve or make note of involved areas?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Preservation.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Does the plan have clause for that?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Furthermore, the duties required by the
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What does proof of maintenance mean exactly?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Images, videos, etc.
Of the maintenance performed.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
So it puts the burden on member states.
Does the CA help in any way with preservation?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I suppose funding could be requested in co-operation with GC, but that hasn't been looked into currently.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It’s just hard to pitch meaningful preservation in the program to me.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Is there any further debate?
Seeing as there no further debate, we will now move onto the third point of business.
The Chair would like to move forward with the first reading of Amendment of the Parliamentary and Legislative Procedures Act.

Thank you.
Is there any further debate?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Mandates that all bills, membership readings, motions, and other business of Parliament undergo at least three readings prior to the holding of a vote.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It only used to be for bills and nothing else.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Other business of Parliament is pretty vague.
Motions as well.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe it's just a catch-all clause for proposals.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
If I motioned to adjourn early, would that have to go through three readings?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Technically, yes.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Then I can't support this in it's current state I am afraid.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Although there's the loophole of a lack of session requirements.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I suppose we could read them three times in a row in one session.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
In theory, I would be able to complain about Mr. Snyder three times in a session then put forward a vote to expel them from the Alliance.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It would probably be best not to allow such loopholes.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I see no need for the catch-all clause or motions clause to be in the amendment.
And also add an amendment to ensure that these readings are in consecutive sessions.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
As bit of as side point, it would probably be best to include the bill we are amending during amendments. Just for ease and reference.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Agreed, although I don't know whether that's down to the Speaker or the agenda's author.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't mean to blame anyone, I just think it would be nice.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
My apologies, what do you mean by that? I'm just confused on what you mean when you say best to include the bill we are amending during amendments.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
As for this topic, we are discussing an amendment but we don't have the bill we are amending to view.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Oh, of course, I’ll post it.

I haven't had much of an opinion on anything around this, so I don't have anything.

Is there any further business?
Seeing as there no further business, we would now like to move on discussion of the confirmation of certain positions and nations.
Brief point of inquiry, I have to do them all separately, correct?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe so.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Very well. First up is Matthew Xia as Minister of Membership Attainment.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support the confirmation. He has shown interest in the position.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Is there any further debate?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I support it as well.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Thank you. Next up is Sertor Valentinus as Deputy Minister of Statistical Affairs.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support the confirmation.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
As before, I support it as well.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Thank you. The final confirmation is Ovrestlia as a full member.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would support the promotion.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Is there any further debate?
Seeing as there no further debate, we will move onto the Membership Attainment section.

The Principality of Misberia's remarks are listed above.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
May I ask, for which micronations are we going to talk about?
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
We only have one nation located in the membership remarks section, and that is the Principality of Misberia.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Thank you!
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
No problem.
Is there any further debate?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not from me.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Very well. We will now provide 10 minutes for any other proposals.
We will also provide 10 minutes for national reports.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
In regards to Misberia, I must add that Misberia seems to change very regularly - they have changed names and dissolved iterations on numerous occasions over the past year.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Empire of Ovrestlia is designing some embassies for some allies to have better contact with them. Also, the overseas citizens living in the USA mourned the victims of the September 11th Attack. Also, we held some events in Park, Canada, spreading peace to the world.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Thank you. My apologies for ending the discussion over Misberia too early.
I now move for adjournment. Thank you all for attending, and helping me out with the Chair.

The floor is open for discussion.
I shall be supportive of the bill.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I personally support the bill.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I can’t support the bill due to the vagueness in one of its clauses which requires almost everything to go through three readings. This was something brought up previously when this was spoken about.
“Mandates that all bills, membership readings, motions, and other business of Parliament”
It was also brought up by Mr. Martin that technically it doesn’t mandate that the readings need to be done at separate sessions.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I have to agree with the Supreme Judge.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Once those are fixed though, I’d be in full support.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Sorry for my absence.
Alright, we may move on.

The floor is open.
I shall be strongly opposed to this proposal and this undermines the views of our esteemed delegates who had with a lot of faith supported the creation of this council just a week back.
Does anyone have anything to comment on this?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Has the council even been formally assembled?

Elava is present
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Berry Empire present.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Indradhanush's second delegate is present
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
You can see that the members have been assigned a role to indicate their status in the council. And further, they are consulted whenever needed.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It just seems as though the repeal has not even given itself the chance to see how the council plays out.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The bill was proposed by Valentinus on the same day when the council was voted in to be formed.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It passed in a vote of 13 to 7, I think that merits a chance before it gets repealed.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Yes, this bill is pretty unecessary and unwarranted.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The bill or the repeal?
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
The repeal, sorry.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Alright I thought that was what you meant but I wanted to be sure, thanks.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I shall strongly voice against the proposal made by Mr. Valentinus.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
Elava is also opposed.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The arguments included in the repeal itself would probably be better enunciated by a spokesperson for the repeal.
They are pretty vague as written.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Sorry for being late, but the Soyuzist Republic is present
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra:

This is their second reading.
I shall support their return.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I concur.
Harrison Dosen Grunning - Elava: 
They would be a very good member. But what has been the reason for them leaving two times?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I support Misberia's application, but I really hope they will be more stable.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I am still confused about their situation in regards to the Confederation of the Northern Coast.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
CoNC is a member of the GUM, not Misberia.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't understand their sovereignty situation I mean.
The CoNC Microwiki article calls itself a sovereign state.
It also says that it is a semi active player in the diplomacy of the MicroWiki Community which implies it conducts diplomacy as a whole but we were also given reports that the individual states do it instead?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Right. I think that is how it works. If you look at the Misberian wikipage, it also calls itself as a sovereign state.
I think CoNC is made up of the three independent &amp; sovereign states; something like the Wurtege Empire.
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/W%25C3%25BCrtige_Empire">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/W%C3%BCrtige_Empire</a>
W%C3%BCrtige_Empire</div>
Please refer.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't understand how the CoNC can be sovereign and Misberia, a part of it, can also be sovereign.
The difference between Wurtige and the CoNC is Wurtige describes itself as 
There is a very big difference in how these two describe themselves.
The CoNC also lists basic principles for it's own foreign policy, which implies that the CoNC is the one engaging in diplomacy as a whole.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
<div class="quote">Misberia is a member of the Holy Roman Empire and a founding state of the Confederation of the Northern Coast.</div>
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I mean I could have all of this very wrong but it feels like im reading one thing and being told another.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes and my state in the KNO, the Kingsland, is a founding state of the Kingdom of Northwood-Oregon and yet it cannot apply to be a CA member state.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I think state in regards to Kingsland would mean like a province same with the 6 Vishwamitran states/provinces.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
But the thing is, the Kingsland is a state in a sovereign nation.
Misberia states that it is a state in something that is claiming to be a sovereign nation.
That is where I am confused on their sovereignty status as it just doesn't make sense to me, do we have a CoNC governing document by any chance?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Present
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As said, same goes for the Vishwamitran states.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I know. I'm drawing comparisons.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Let me find if they have submitted any such documents.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Thank you, I can't find it on the article but I may be overlooking a link.

I think this should be helpful
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What about for the CoNC by any chance? Or the Treaty of Jacobia-Nova Maria which seems to be what made the state.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Arborism?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
No, they have not submitted anything such.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I've never heard of such a method of governing.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This may help.
Communitarian Arborism</div>

Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Interesting.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't want what I am bringing up here to imply that I don't think Misberia would be a good member. I just wish to be thorough in our understanding of their situation.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Ah
So it's a mixture of a bunch of ideas and systems, Kinda like Soyuzism.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia will be sporadically present
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does anyone have anything to comment on Misberia's application?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I do
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Please go ahead.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I think it's worth mentioning that their leader has taken some rather ridiculous moderation actions towards other users, including some CA delegates (my secondary delegate, and Ponderosa Hills' Delegate, among others.) However, I believe they will be fine as an observer to the CA.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As you brought this up, I shall inform you that our Safeguarding Officer had carried out his investigation and found out some information regarding one Wendatian delegate and one Pondoresan delegate and also came with the reason why the Misberian applicant delegate has taken action on the two.
It has nothing to do with their application, but raises our question on the two delegates though
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
sigh
Alright, i will be abstaining
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Please keep the venue formal and maintain decorum.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Alright.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does anyone have anything to comment?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I just wish to say that it will be nice to have them back
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I agree.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I've said all I had, and I hope that some explanation with documents behind it will come of it.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright, I shall provide 10 minutes to all delegates if they wish to come up with something before adjourning the session.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The session has been adjourned.

Feel free to discuss this
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Whilst, in concept, I support it, I don't really feel this should be happening, considering the majority were for it.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Yeah, I guess it's the same for me
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I think an advisory council seems like only an empty layer of bureaucracy.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Indeed
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Does anyone have anything to add?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Nothing from me
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Let's move on.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I think an advisory council seems like only an empty layer of bureaucracy.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
We have the application of the Principality of Misberia.

These are their remarks.
I personally support Misberia's application
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Principality of Misberia? Since when?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
A few weeks ago apparently.
Souver-Birch: 
New Athens is present
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Me too
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Sorry for being late, Humberlea is present.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
No offense, but from my personal point of view their governmental status is as predictable as a DVD logo bouncing around on a screen. They seem like a professional and reputed Fesmar.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I support the application as well.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I.. can't say you're wrong.
Souver-Birch: 
Misberia has stopped changing governments following the removal of many younger citizens
Which was the issue
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Even so, I for one trust the new Misberia
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Time will tell, until then I support giving them a chance.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I support the application of Misberia as an observer, however we need them to prove they can keep the stability.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">is as predictable as a DVD logo bouncing around on a screen.
Souver-Birch: 
Misberia has had its government focused onto a small scale, stability seems to be there, obviously, time will tell
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That was a bit of a quick move of topic.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
There's nothing left on the agenda, and we did talk about Misberia quite a bit.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Six minutes?
Souver-Birch: 
That does seem rushed
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Discussion hadn't exactly stopped.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I guess we can keep it going then?
That's fine by me
Please continue
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
His Imperial Majesty has declared the opening of the Electoral Period for the ensuing elections on 2nd Oct. 2021
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Soyuzist republic is late, but present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I do have one question, would Misberia be subject to losing its authority over its foreign affairs by CoNC rule?
Souver-Birch: 
No, that has been made clear Misberia's foreign affairs is its own affairs, not the CoNC's
James Roberts: 
Indradhanush is present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Could that change?
Souver-Birch: 
No, it is dictated in the foundation treaty
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The one you sent yesterday right?
Souver-Birch: 
Yes, it is in the process of being updated
Minor word updates and adding new nations to the treaty from what I have heard
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Could we by any chance see what it would be changed to?
Souver-Birch: 
Of course

Updates were also made regarding things approved by the Presidency since the foundation, including language and the Cupertino Alliance question.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
All states are from the North-Eastern U.S? Hence the name right?
Souver-Birch: 
One is in Washington State, but yes, the Northeast is where most members are from
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
<div class="quote">The agreement with the Holy Roman Empire and Misberia is one which is between these two only, with membership in the Grand Unified Micronational, Cupertino Alliance and Borean Community being approved by Confederation leadership as the successor to Misberia.</div>
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Holy Roman Empire?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
So do you have control over your foreign affairs or is your membership in the CA being approved by the group in charge of your foreign affairs?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Holy Roman Empire?
Souver-Birch: 
It would appear it was placed in the wrong spot, it is on the same level as the HRE
My apologies, this is a working document at the moment
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I'm afraid that doesn't directly answer my question.
Is your membership being approved by the group in charge of your foreign affairs or do you have control over your foreign affairs?
Souver-Birch: 
My membership was approved as an exception to the foreign affairs policy of the Confederation
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
So Misberia does not hold sole jurisdiction over it's foreign affairs.
Souver-Birch: 
In regards to some organisations yes, others no
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Pinelandia is present (I apologize for my tardiness).
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I just find it difficult to admit a member state that doesn't have full authority over it's foreign affairs.
It reminds me of the issue of when, I believe, Potunia became part of Austenasia.
Souver-Birch: 
That would be a fair concern, and aye that is a similar situation, however we have legal right and powers to oversee some of our own foreign affairs, whereas Pontunia did not
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes but the thing is that legal right could be rescinded I assume.
Souver-Birch: 
It can not, it is our foundation treaty and agreed upon by the Confederation that those exceptions were rights that could not be infringed upon.
If they were, Misberia would leave the Confederation.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Isn't this allowance being added to the foundation treaty? I mean that leads me to assume it can be altered.
Souver-Birch: 
The allowance as the Confederation has seen it as a assumed thing given the Holy Roman Empire exception, when discussing the foundation treaty the Cupertino Alliance was not at the forefront of current agreements or memberships being considered.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
This is all a bit confusing for me, is there any way to simplify the current situation?
Souver-Birch: 
Misberia has some legal rights to have its own foreign affairs, as apart of that we have applied to the Cupertino Alliance, questions and concerns over the situation are being asked.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
So is it simmilair to an Enclave citystate? Like Melila?
Or more like a Russian national enclave, like Chechnya
Souver-Birch: 
I heard of the similarity between the USSR and Ukraine in the UN
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I've asked what I needed to ask and got fine answers. I believe my colleagues have other concerns or don't share this one as it hasn't really been brought up by others. 
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
If its able to establish its own limited foreign affairs it seems fair to apply.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Alright, does anybody have anything more to add?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't have anything else, like I said before I think Misberia would be a fine member of the CA, the foreign affairs issue was the only thing I wanted to inquire about.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
You all may post your national reports.
Snagov: Local election started on the 18th, will finish today, and results will be shown tommorow. Turn out was pretty low, around 35%.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
His Imperial Majesty has declared the opening of the Electoral Period for the ensuing elections on 2nd Oct. 2021
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The Kingdom of Northwood-Oregon recently signed the Turtle-Woodtick agreement with Paloma resolving a territorial dispute with the state. The treaty saw Paloma relinquish it's claims over Turtle Island and instead claim the nearby Woodtick Peninsula, and saw both parties recognize the other's authority over their respective territories.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Soyuzist Republic is preparing to hold contact and establish a series of communication efforts between local villages. Also, information on the local Zawiya has been found, and it seems that it was active in the 60's till the 90's untill it slowly deterred during a large exodus of berber Tribal villages. Right now, the building seems to be either abandonned, or barely used. We are also preparing to get rid of squaters in Massif de Gurugu if spotted.

Moving along, the floor is open to discussion regarding the promotion of the Kingdom of Indradhanush to full member.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I am in support of their promotion.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Pinelandia is present.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am in support as well. Their delegate has shown activity and professionalism, and I think they would be a positive addition to the alliance.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Wendatia has no comment against the observer and supports it promotion to full membership
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I see no problem with their promotion, it seems that they have moved past their previous grievances.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
I concur.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Moving on to applicants, the first applicant is the Micronational Empire of Thebes

Max I - Englica: 
I concur for indradhush
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
It's Indradhanush
Max I - Englica: 
Sorry
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
It means Rainbow in Hindi
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Is there any further discussion on the Micronational Empire of Thebes?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Personally from what I read on their microwiki page I am opposed to their application
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I have no comment on them at this point in time.
Souver-Birch: 
I have not interacted with them before, reading over their page, I agree with the delegate from Yu-Xia
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Please elaborate.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
It seems there isn’t much activity after 2019 and their history is filled with “war” and conflict
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I noticed that as well
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
At least that was the impression I got while creating their remarks.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Must have had some sporadic activity if they applied two years later after its founding.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
Perhaps.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Next we have the Republic of Surdam
Remarks - Republic of Surdam</div>

Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I am opposed to this application due to their recent involvement in the Kapresh Civil War
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Weren't they involved in conflict for quite some time?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is present.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe so from what I’ve gathered.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is opposed to this application.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Personally I agree.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I am somewhat opposed to their application.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Jonas Rhymer pointed out yesterday that they may have been behind the Rantov Raids.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I dont know much about these wars to be fully honest, could someone inform me?
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
That is even more alarming.
Souver-Birch: 
It would appear they are seeking drama or conflict, which is concerning
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
This could certainly become a safeguarding or security concern.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
I concur
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
I concur.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I concur with all of the above concerns.
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I don’t have too much information to be honest, I really only know of their involvement via their microwiki page
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It appears that we have a consensus. Finally, we have the Principality of Galte

Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I am in full support of their application.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I believe many of us already know them and their delegate well. I support them.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I’ll abstain for now considering I’m the head of state, but I’m happy to answer any questions you guys may have.
Souver-Birch: 
I have only heard good things of the Principality of Galte
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
I concur. They recently finished their general elections.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I will abstain, as I'm in the government.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That concludes this session's agenda. I'll allow for 10 minutes for new business and nation reports.
New Athens is currently manufacturing hardcover passports.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Wendatia has no comment against the observer and supports it promotion to full membership
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
An executive order on classified information was recently passed in Yu-Xia, and the election process is in full swing.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Indradhanush recently adopted a new flag designed by Stefan Marius Snagoveanu. The flag combines the old Lowenia flag and the Indradhanush blue star flag.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Al Soyuzia is working on officiallising their national orchestra, Al T'urkista ħalami de Soyuzia, by releasing a recent composition they made using the melody from famous Turkish song, &#220;skadara Gideriken. The composition will most likely be made using three guitarist and a Cajon, but a Darbuka might be included as well.
Souver-Birch: 
The National Archives and Library of Misberia is getting its own website with parts being released in late October and onward
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
We have also been working on a logo, but that hasn't been finished yet
The first draft has been looking like this
But works are being done to fix the blurriness
And overall weirdness of the logo
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
May I add something I was sent by the Thebian delegation that may be beneficial to understanding their nation and their apparent lack of activity?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Go ahead
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
<strong>Imperial Grand Duchy of Lundenwic</strong>
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
“Regarding your remarks about Thebes, We have been not as active on our Microwiki as we have been in other forms of archival. I am appointing a team to update the wiki page. We have a book of our activity this year, its around 600 pages, i can scan it in and send it to you if you would like. We also have not been in wars since then, as those first 2 eras were the largest struggle for us since we had a ton of micronations that were against us since they were the leaders in micronations in that area, i have introduced a policy into thebes to ban declarations of war from the theban side.” - Thebian Foreign Affairs Consul
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
If that's true, then I'd be very impressed. 600 pages is a lot of history.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Understood now.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Wendatia will be holding a referendum on its future.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Can you clarify?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Can we get them to scan and send it? I would be really interested in reading it.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I would like to read it as well
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Simply if it should dissolve, join another state or continue as is. The country has been very inactive lately and I've assumed executive powers since Rhymer has stepped down.
Souver-Birch: 
Misberia data hordes, so if they have been around for a few years I can see it happening
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
I believe they are doing so right now
Souver-Birch: 
I would love to read it as well
Matthew Xia - Yu-Xia: 
For now they have provided a picture of a physical copy, they say it will take them a few days to get it to us
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That's understandable
At this point, I'd like to thank you all for attending this productive session. This session is adjourned.

Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Very well, it seems we can begin.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Our first order of business today is the  discussion of two members to be promoted to the full membership. First up is the United Republic of Englica.
Max I - Englica: 
Hello
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
The floor is now open for debate.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra's first delegate is also present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well.
Max I - Englica: 
I’d like to be a full member so I could participate in some of the projects the alliance has going, like twin towns
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I assume by you you mean Englica.
Max I - Englica: 
Yes
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Is there any further debate?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Having looked into it a little, and based on the information I have gathered thus far at least, I would not support the promotion of Englica as a full member.
Max I - Englica: 
Why is that?
If you have some issues, I’m happy to improve my nation
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Well something conserns me on their 2+ million kilometers of land claims as well as their admittance of and I quote Land is [on] the surface of an undiscovered star in the Andromeda Galaxy
Max I - Englica: 
We gave up those claims
The members of the royal family of Hilltop still own them but they do not comprise any part of Englica
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Why does Hilltop not allow any non-Christian religious buildings?
Max I - Englica: 
It’s poorly written, it should be that there aren’t any, we do have Christianity promoted and any non Christian building might cause a stir with some of the more right wingers
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
You should really clear that up then. I will stand on my answer due to lack of sufficient and up-to-date information.
Unless you have a website that is accurate
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah I somewhat support that.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I agree with the statements provided.
The overall quality of the page is rather poor in addition.
Max I - Englica: 
How could I improve my page?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
So they are allowed but there aren't any because it would cause problems?
Max I - Englica: 
There aren’t any because there aren’t any non Christians/Atheists
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
In just Hilltop?
Max I - Englica: 
There is a small population of COFD who attend a congregation of Bertia
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">How could I improve my page?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Provide up to date and useful information for example.
Make it more reliable
Max I - Englica: 
I’m trying to do that
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is present, albeit short. I shall now give my input in regards to impending promotion votes:
Max I - Englica: 
But with pages and pages it can be hard to keep track
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Except for me editing it today it hasn't been edited since March.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would like to inform all present members that this is not the first time that Englica's application has been put for promotion. This is the second time. The last time they were rejected and retained observership.
Max I - Englica: 
I think you’ve got the wrong page
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/United_Royal_Republic_of_Englica">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/United_Royal_Republic_of_Englica</a>
United Royal Republic of Englica</div>
The United Republic of Englica is a micronation founded by Jonah Nichols (King Jonah I) and Max Stenner (King Max I) on 15 May 2020, originally as the Kingdom of Woodshire Hill but became a republic when it merged with the Republic of New Potato Land but there were still subnational monarchs. This micronation was founded due to all information o...</div>
Is the currect one
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's a different page.
Max I - Englica: 
It’s complicated
There are two pages, one was created by me and the other by the other co founders
And hasn’t been updated
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would suggest getting rid of the other page if it isn't a second nation then.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am present once again to comment on the statement by Mr. Roy:
Max I - Englica: 
The page I have linked is still updated fairly regularly
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What changes have been made for the nation as a whole since the last promotion vote?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I still think there is not a sufficient and moreso no organized source of information for Englica and until there is we should postpone their admission.
Max I - Englica: 
A two day conference was held to improve the relations between two of the sub-monarchies
Hilltop and Bertia
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
To note, they are an observer. They are put for a promotion.
They are already admitted to the alliance, but they're non-voting delegates.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
(I think you knew very well what I meant)
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Yes I did. Still, that could have created confusion so I corrected.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Very well, final call for debate.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Unless Englica shows more dedication to internal development and their presences here, then I will oppose their promotion, or I may consider expulsion.
Max I - Englica: 
I do
I attend sessions quite a lot, and I do show dedication to internal development
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
You may, but I think he's referring to Englica and not you.
Max I - Englica: 
I represent Englica
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
But you aren’t Englica.
You are a mere part of Englica.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Of course your representation of Englica matters a lot but I believe he is referring to, like myself, regarding national development as a whole.
Max I - Englica: 
There is also the Acting Prime Minister, who I act on behalf of here
I quite often raise matters with him
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
How many Prime Ministers have you had in your history?
This will raise the matter of stability.
Max I - Englica: 
One
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
So the Acting Prime Minister?
Max I - Englica: 
Yes
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I don't think this has any relevance and I suggest we move on
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
In that case, sure.
Max I - Englica: 
Just to clarify, He’s the Acting PM because the election has been stalled
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Thank you for your statements. I’d now like to move onto the next nation up for discussion, the Kingdom of Indradhanush.
Max I - Englica: 
I support their admission
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I have given my input earlier, for reference:
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Adhering to my personal observations, I support their promotion.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I will no longer be present.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Is there any further debate?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I don't have much to say. I was leaning abstain but then again I see dedication in some form which led me to support them. Though the basis of my answer may be uneducated.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Thank you all for your statements.We will now move onto membership attainments. First up is the Empire of Thebes.

The floor is now open for debate.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
This is a very poor report. Not because of its handling by the ministry, I hope at least. But because of its contents.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It seems most of their history is centered around war.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
And the level of originality in their governmental development gave me hopes but then again, little activity past the year 2019.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/The_Micronational_Empire_of_Thebes">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/The_Micronational_Empire_of_Thebes</a>
The Micronational Empire of Thebes</div>
The Micronational Empire of Thebes was founded on June 19, 2019 by Eithan Ackerman and Charles Miller. It rules several territories on Lake Gaston, Virginia, and is currently led by Alexander I. It has a population of about 115 and has conquered several other micronations[citation needed].</div>
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We also still haven't gotten that additional information that we requested a bit ago.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
What additional information?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The 600 pages of information their king claimed they had.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Thanks but I was referring to the report only
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
If you'll excuse me, I just received a message, I would assume from a representative of the Empire of Thebes that their MicroWiki is outdated and they're working to fix it.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Novus Hierosolymis is intermittently present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes it says that in the infobox.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 

Apparently they haven't been able to send it because their, let me find it.
Consul of Education is on holiday.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
If I may, I've been asked to include a quote: Thebes has not been at war since 2019, We have been at peace, and formed alliances with several other nations. We have been doing a lot of in-person things, so we have not had the time to put things on microwiki. We are working to do that as a part of our revitilize21 plan.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Yes, they also noted that to me, as well.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
This is bit weird as they claim to have a 600 page information but when sought for, it is informed that Consul of Edu. is on holiday.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
As well, our archival person has been on vacation for 2 weeks in Montana, so he has not had access to internet.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would like to see photos of such events in-person, because their King seems to prioritize asking if other nations use expensive pens.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I believe we got a picture of their book
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Do we have that available?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I will look for it but I believe I saw it somewhere
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Right and also claiming to use a very expensive gold pen
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That should be Jayden Lycon's book, I think.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Here
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I see. That seems like a bundle of files.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Cayden has claimed to me in DMs that he's spent thousands of his own money on digitization for Thebes so I don't know why they wouldn't have the book of all things available.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Here's another quote by them: We do not prefer to rank nations based on what pens they use. We were just wondering if it was common in the micronational community.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
You seem very obsessed with disproving their claims, let's judge them with what information we have instead.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I don't think digitization even need a lot of money. Many online scanning apps are available.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I don't think their pen for example is relevant
But that might be only me
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It seemed relevant to them when they brought it up.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We don't really have any then.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Right that's the issue I think we should be focusing on, not the existence of their book or the price of their pen
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The pen example was to show that they seem to be caught up on that but not updating their microwiki page.
My interactions and what I have seen seem to suggest a lot of claimed monetary investment, but not much that we can see.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Speaking of their system of administration, I think they have quite detailed system. But we are not aware on how those works.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
If they barely have the capacity to uphold their source of information and their general online presence, how are they going to have the capacity to uphold their membership in the CA? I think this is a pattern, those who focus mainly locally amongst themselves can barely balance that with taking part in the CA and end up doing about nothing until they are kicked.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">To note, that the applicant delegate Cayden has addressed some concerns at <span class="mention">#formal</span>
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
(But this is just me speculating based on the impression I have.)
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I feel as though I have to abstain or be against until we can see the things that Thebes claims.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I’m leaning against their application.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
This is also their final reading and they do not seem to have enough time to provide all evidences sought for before their application is put to vote.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I see.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I will believe what they say until it is proven false, and I will generally support giving them a chance. But as of right now I will be neutral to their admission.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We can only operate after what we are given, if all of it is true I think they would be excellent members but we have to act with skepticism until then.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There is no possible way to prove that it's false. If I say I have a Maserati in my garage you couldn't say I don't until you come check. The burden of proof has to fall on them because they made the claim.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The applicant has sought for an extension of a week which is not seemingly possible. I had suggested them to withdraw their application and re-apply with all necessary updates and evidences.
That should be the best thing on which we can agree.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
If we are given their 600 pages of scans I would say that's sufficient proof for whether or not they have 600 pages of history.
Doesn't need to be any more complicated than that
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It would be proof. But we don't have those 600 pages, so we must assume its false until then.
It's very easy to lie, and while I hope that those 600 pages can get to us, we can't admit based on something we don't have.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I'd like to move onto the following application, if it's allowed by the attendees.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't have anything further at the moment.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from me. Better to move.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Next up is the Republic of Surdam.

Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I would like to bring something before the members. In July, the nation was involved in some serving raids, wars, etc and I was tasked by the GUM Chair to prepare a report as their application was pending. Based on interaction with their President, I had prepared the following report:
The President did not clarify who that citizen is and why he did so.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Berry Empire is present
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Did the government prosecute this citizen?
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
We suggest excluding discord raiders from the alliance as it's childish.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The President did not provide any further information, except saying that the citizen did it individually and not behalf of the nation. 
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Hopefully the government did not provoke nor care as this was a discord raid
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I see. Yes, I agree with your point.
Is there any further debate?
Very well, we will move onto the final applicant.

The final applicant is the Principality of Galte.
The floor is now open for debate.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
As stated in the previous readings, as the head of state of Galte, I am happy to answer any question that Parliament may have regarding our application.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I shall openly and without any hesitation support the application of Galte.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I would note a minor error in the remarks, our delegate during our observership (should we be admitted) would not be myself, but would be William Cooper. If we gain full membership, I would become primary delegate. A simple workaround so I don’t have to resign from my Cabinet post for 2 weeks or so.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
That mentions the name of the applicant (which was you) and the name of the ruler.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
It appears I can’t read today. I do apologize.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But, will William Cooper be active during the two weeks period?
Moletopia was expelled due to his inactivity.
Michael S. - Novus Hierosolymis: 
He did promise his activity for this period, and I’m a person who prefers to take someone by their word; but in the event he is not I have other people I could ask to take on the role.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Alright. Thanks for the clarification.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Is there any further debate?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
None from my end.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I have nothing to add but my support.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Thank you all for your statements. This concludes the business of the agenda. We will now provide 10 minutes to our attendees for new business or national reports.

Noted.
The first order of business today is the discussion of promotion of two observer members to full membership. First up is the United Republic of Englica. The floor is now open for debate.
Personally, I do not see any problem with them and from my personal interactions they seem professional.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
No comments for me. I am happy with the consensus of the members here
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I Concur, they seem fit for the organisation.
Any further discussion on the topic?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
None from me
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Wonderful. We shall now move onto the second nation for discussion, the Kingdom of Indradhanush. The floor is now open for debate
Personally, whilst I use to look at them poorly I think they have developed their nation productively and will now make a good addition to our alliance.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This nation has had a troubled past, but I believe the delegate has made amends and therefore I think the nation can both contribute and benefit from membership to this organisation.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The soyuzist republic is present
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Indradhanush's second delegate is present
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Noted.
Rory - Lurdentania:

Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur, I believe they have effectively brought themself up to be a respectable micronation with a respectable delegation.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Wait, weren't observers shown separately? Englica has it, but Indradhanush hasn't
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I believe that is simply a mess up in permissions.
Any further comments or discussion?
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Well, I want to say something regarding Englica.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Go ahead.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Englica as per reading CA session infos
I feel they should rather be observer
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Why do you feel that way?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Why?
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Personal Opinion
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Could you perhaps elaborate or is that all you have to say?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Yes, but how did you come to that opinion?
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Yes I have that much
First of all, they have made 2 pages on the same country.
The founder has one type of history while the others have a different type
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I have heard yes, but I do not believe a nation microwiki page should be the sole basis of all judgement... Lurdentania's page isnt the greatest but yet we still got accepted.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
I call that cobbling all info in 1 page.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Pardon?
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Yes
Rory - Lurdentania: 
What do you mean by cobbling?
You mean it was created poorly?
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
I respect and understand your views but you took all info and put it into 1 single page.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Are you refering to the remarks?
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Indradhanush's second delegate will be absent
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Noted.
Is there any further discussion on this topic?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
None from me.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Thank you all for your contributions, we shall now move onto Membership attainment. First up we have the 1st reading for the  Empire of Northway:

My personal opinions are that due to their involvement in conflict etc. and because alot of their nation needs 'improvement' I will be abstaining as of now, until I here more about them/their delegation.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I am present on behalf of Novus Hierosolymis.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Noted.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Another nation from Essex, UK. When will it stop? In all seriousness though, I would like to see more of them in a provisional capacity to better understand if they are a good fit for the organisation.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I believe Northway applied a month ago if I recall correctly?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
The remarks say they replied on the ffith of this month.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Let me check the last agendas
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Do you mean they were rejected a month ago?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Yes they did apply earlier, and got rejected.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
From reading their remarks, the current form of their nation was only formed on the 7/8/2021, which could be a hint towards some instability but I am unsure.
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
This is the second time they applied.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Do you know of any improvements/developments since their last application?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I don't see any visible improvements.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I agree with your point. I'm a little biased in that it is another nation from the UK.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I suppose I would support them for observership to see how they go.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Maybe this is a good compromise
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I would be interested on what grounds were they previously rejected for.
Any further discussion on the topic?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Some grounds for rejection raised included claims that were unrealistic.
According to the previous Minister of Membership Attainment.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Have such unrealistic claims been dealt with by the nation?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
The citizen claim is now reasonable to me.
I would abstain on the application.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I would support observership, abstain on full membership.
Is that all for this discussion?
Very well, let's move onto the 1st reading for the Democratic Christian Republic of Melite: 
Remarks - Democratic Christian Republic of Melite</div>

Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
Supportive.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
This nation in my personal opinion seems professional. They have relations with a member state, New Athens, and seem to have a good history and effective government structure with seemingly realistic claims. I will support them for Membership.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I'm quite excited by a nation from Malta as it one of my favourite countries. I just hope they are able to meet my expectations!
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
I am again present and I Agree with above
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Noted.
Any other comments?
Very well, do any members have any further business?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
If I may?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Go ahead.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I would just like to thank and congratulate all members that participated in the Culture Festival. It was very well run and provided us all with some insight into each others nations. I would like to give special thanks to Tyler Mullins for organising it. It was a pleasure to be a part of.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I concur, the Culture Festival was a great success and wonderful learning experience.
That is it for the agenda, I will now allow 10 Minutes to our attendees for National Reports before the Adjournment of the session.
Lurdentania recently celebrated its 3rd foundation day, a wonderful celebration, announcement of awards, election and military parades were held throughout the day, with many statements, meetings and planning occuring for the futrue of our nation as we looked forward to the future of our nation.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
<strong>The Imperial Grand Duchy of Lundenwic</strong>
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Indradhanush has been on a diplomatic spree by signing diplomatic treaties with 3 nation in 3 days. It signed a treaty with Winterspell on 5th October, Salanda on the 6th and Arsalania on 7th.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Good to hear. I now adjourn the 133rd Session, thank you for your attendance.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
I actually recommended Winterspell to apply for the CA.

The Sovereign Empire of Northway, commonly known as Northway, is a micronation created in Essex as the brainchild of founder King Miles I. He's the current king with a presidency being established later on; in 2019. On the 11th June, 2021, Northway became a member state of the Micronational Assembly but it left 2 months later.

The floor is open for discussion.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I had a few concerns in the last session, I do believe they have previously been rejected.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That’s what I recall.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe that becoming an observer could benefit this nation, however I would encourage them to gradually loosen their claims over several large towns if they want to be taken more seriously.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What has changed since their last application?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
They were rejected for unrealistic claims, which has changed.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not much. They don't claim the population to be over 100,000 anymore, but I believe they do still claim the land.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
I concur. Maybe give more specified/realistic information.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Let me find what I said about it.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
And do we know why they left Micronational Assembly?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
To seek a more mature organisation
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Oh...
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe they claim the towns of Leigh-on-Sea and Southend-on-Sea in south-east England, Southend containing a sizeable international airport.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
They claim an airport?!
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
There isn't an exact map of their claims but I believe they do.
It might be excluded from their claims, however.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
If they claim an airport then it will have to be a No from me.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
A few members of the alliance have criticized Northway's claims on controlled land, including an international airport, and citizens (300 thousand).
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
For now, I would assume they have dropped the claim of London's 6th airport.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
It's ok if they want to be an active micronation, but they have to take it more seriously.
And give real information.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Anything else to add?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
None here
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Nothing from me
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Let's move on.
2. Democratic Christian Republic of Melite
Democratic Christian Republic of Melite</div>
The D.C.R.M., (shortened to D.C.R.), officially the Second Democratic Christian Republic of Melite, and formerly the Democratic Christian Republic of 11B (D.C.R. 11B) is a micronation located in Malta. Founded in a secondary school in 2019, it lasted 2 scholastic years in the capital, Santa Venera, and had two national flags before having the ca...</div>

Rory - Lurdentania: 
I support their acceptance.
Ezri Ambriz: 
I disagree, there flag looks ugly
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
When was this nation founded?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
2019
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Their microwiki page says 2019, first edit was in 2021 and says it was founded in 2020.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
27/9/19
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
As does Pibocip's, but that's no reason to reject a nation.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yeah I’m looking deeper than that.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
And also, don't they claim lots of land in Malta?
Check out the map.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I find their claim a bit large, but otherwise support their admission. They are professional and friendly, and have signed MRTs with multiple current members of the Cupertino Alliance.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Hm, their land claim seems large, but if they can back it up.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
How big is there landclaim?
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
After seeing the remarks, I can agree with you, but the land they claim confuses me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
They also claim a heliport in Comino.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I’m confused why there are so many contradictions with their foundation on their microwiki page.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe they have been through multiple stages of government. The differing foundation dates may be a mis-translation.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Could it be when they went from simulationist to successionisf?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Possibly? I'm a bit unsure myself.
Maybe the date of declaration of independence.

Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
RR?
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
It seems to be that the map has changed
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Alright, I support their entrance.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
But they continue to claim the airport.
Do they?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Do you mean the Berry Empire?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm unsure.
Any further discussion?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I guess I support their entrance.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
If they can fix these issue, I surely support their entrance. But I think they should change it as soon as possible.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I concur.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Is that all?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I’m not sure how to feel about the applicant.
Do we not include their reason for wanting to join in the remarks sheet anymore or am I missing it?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I don't think we do anymore.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Floriland will no longer be present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Is there any further discussion on the applicant?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I wish we included them.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Yes
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It’s difficult to have an opinion sometimes when I don’t know why they want to join.
Are they here for development?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Judging by their attempted application to the GUM and the ongoing application to the LIN, I have to assume it's for diplomacy over all else.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I mean it’s a question on the application I would just figure it be included. It helps with perspective.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I think you should speak to Mr. Xia about that.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Also, I question the merit more recently of admitting members for diplomacy.
The projects we have for diplomacy aren’t exactly, widely used anymore.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm surprised the cultural festival didn't feature a convention on recognition that could be signed, like the Berard-Malloy Convention from that fun thing a while ago.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We’ve just been lacking in those things.
I’ll just be abstaining, I just worry about how much we are doing to help.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Should we move on?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It’s fine with me.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
I think so
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'll leave 10 minutes for national reports, then we'll adjourn at 20:07 UTC.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I think the CA could do more events where micronations could sign large recognition treaties or anti-greenhouse-anti-co2 treaties.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Green town council met with the Royal Office and the Department for Agriculture and the Environment to tackle the growing issue of litter in the nation.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Empire of Ovrestlia held elections last week, with George Z. winning 21 of 50 seats. However, the new government hasn't been created yet. In order not to create a confusion, we will declare elections as soon as possible and create a new Council with 20 seats. Finally, Ovrestlia's observership application to GUM was accepted.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
With that, I adjourn the 134th session of the Cupertino Alliance at 20:07 UTC.

We do not have much to discuss about today, so let's get right into it.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Sure.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Humberlea is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We have our first reading for the Micronear being acquisitioned by the Cupertino Alliance.

Here is Micronear if you don't know, it is also on the Google Play Store.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Ovrestlia is present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Getting acquisitioned would bring new nations to the CA.
The floor is open for discussion.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think that it would be great for the CA to maintain the project, but obviously the most difficult thing will be making sure we have the capacity to maintain it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur; will this be viable?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Agreed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We have a spark of new applicants, we could possibly appoint new people?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Alright. I am interested to see this
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I think that we should avoid this until we can be certain that we could sustain Micronear.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think it has great potential, and I am not opposed about it.
William Wilson - Stormhold: 
Would you mind expanding on this point?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
One of the hardest questions would be funding it.
And having capable people who could participate in whatever coding needs it would bring.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
With that, people would get more knowledge about the Cupertino Alliance, and would want to try to get in and boost their nation.
It's more of a great likelihood.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
William Wilson - Stormhold: 
Thank you. I was confused, I thought it might have meant that nations who had been registered in the app would also be incorporated as members.
Cole Baird - Wegmat: 
Wegmat is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Nothing like that.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would hate to see the project disappear, but I also wouldn’t want to just extend its existence temporarily because we couldn’t properly maintain it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
It seems to be popular though.
There is 63 nations in it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Does anyone have any ideas on how we would hypothetically maintain or fund it?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hmm.
William Wilson - Stormhold: 
I think, relative to the long term impact of the diaspora of Micronational communities, it is beneficial and a worthy investment for the CA.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The soyuzist republic is present for a short period.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We pretty much can't unless we make a fundraiser of some sort.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe the developer said it was around $2 USD a month to fund? If my memory serves me right atleast.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Oh well.
That's somewhat easy.
We don't really need to discuss funding if it's only $2.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Because we’ve just relied on donations previously haven’t we? I say we but I’m referring to the green cities projects which was before me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I believe we did.
It's not as expensive however.
We can handle it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Indeed, we just have to make sure people would be willing to donate.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
would you be willing to help with the technical affairs of running the project?
Hopefully they will find that message when it suits them.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, does anyone wish to add anything further before we move on?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don’t have anything else at the moment.

This is their third time applying I think?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If I remember correctly they were ousted from the CA last time for a reason that has since lost me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hard no from me.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
One search of the word Cimbrun on this server will show why it should not be allowed anywhere near here.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Whats the issue with Cimbrun?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
The reason should not be mentioned in a formal setting such as this.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Is there some history I do not know about?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They just have made very bad choices which give them a bad rep.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Bad choices?
Oh
Damn
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Just bad leadership and stuff.
Please decorum.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
That's a way to put it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Indeed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Also.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Safeguarding
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Seems like the safeguarding officer didn't approve, more as lack there-of.
Alright moving on.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Hello, what session is this?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We have the Triumvirate of Sonderan.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
American.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Alright thanks.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm in support of admitting Sonderan as they are very professional.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Again the safeguarding officer didn't approve this, but let's just run through this nation right now.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I have no issues with Sonderan.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I agree.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
They seem very nice, I'd approve of them joining.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I concur.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They seem perfect for the CA.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I mean, I don't think that the Safeguarding Officer is the best source of factual information as shown by previous applications.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True but the whole point of their role is to safeguard the alliance.
Moving on.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Also, the leader of Sonderan was the GUM's Safeguarding Officer and from what I know, seemed to be professional and successful at her job.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Ovrestlia is no longer present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We have the Kingdom of Terrerit.

They have no remarks.
Probably a no from me.
They seem unprofessional and a joke.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
They don't very much like they are trying.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The page looks alright from a glance.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Its a no for me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Are you able to change your name?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">kingdom of Terrerit&#233; became the first-ever micronation to have a published EP with the uploading of programmed independence on 23 September 2021
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Oh.
An EP?
James B. - Desert District: 
I have done just that.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Good.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Extended play record.
Kasra - Saspearian: 
Hi
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Like an album but shorter.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Oh.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hello and decorum.
James B. - Desert District: 
The person from Dance Moms is in the government?…
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Ignoring Birddog, of Aenopia.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Are they though?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I guess..?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Theres a high chance some obscure micronation did the same thing before that period.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
No, they're the Lady of Terrerit&#233;, I believe she accepted an offer.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I think I'll either abstain or oppose their membership.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I oppose.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I too, oppose.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I do not see how they would harm the Alliance.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Ignoring Birddog, of Aenopia.

We have the Empire of Northway.
I feel like I remember them somewhere, is this their second time applying?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yes.
Last time, I believe I abstained.
They seem to have improved their claims.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes it seems so.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What makes them an empire?

The Sovereign Empire of Northway, commonly known as Northway, is a micronation created in Essex as the brainchild of founder King Miles I.

Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They just claim it I guess.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Tesforia shall be intermittently present as I am currently at a family gathering
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
After gaining the colonies of Lulworth and Worrell, on the 7th of August, the Republic of Northway changed its name to the Empire of Northway.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Pinelandia is present.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I will likely abstain for Northway.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Noted.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
They seem very professional, and their claim to being an empire would actually work since they have external territories.
I accept.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I accept them.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Looking into it more, they seem quite professional. I will think on it more.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright moving on.

A no from me.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Absolutely a no.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Their flag is something else.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
They’ve shown to be very unprofessional on r/Micronations.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Their flag is honestly one of the most beautiful flags I've ever seen.

Yeah.

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I mean, Pibocip is very well-regarded here despite their horrendously despicable flag. And whenever I see their flag, I genuinely want to look away. It's truly horrible. Sometimes when I see it, I want to die, and take Philip with me.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
That’s true, but that war says a lot.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The war has reaffirmed my position on them.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It seems they are very religious and will wage war if someone doesn't believe in their god.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
How so?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Wage war?
In what sence?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.

Phillip - Pibocip: 
Thank you!... To be fair, though, our flag is almost 20 years old!
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I will most likely oppose the application.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
They invaded....over twitter?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yes.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
How does twitter warfare even function?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It doesn't.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don't even know.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
This is wild, but interesting.
I'll look further into it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Does anyone wish to add anything else?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
You said they were very religious.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
About all you need to know.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
and you'll see.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
What do you mean by that?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, they have Christianity in their name also.
Not that it's a problem but it just points it out.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I, of course, do not really agree with the membership standards of the GUM, but this shows that it is a LIN-sphere nation.
Combined with their crisis and other things.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Their leader claims they are always on the defending side in warfare. Does this claim hold truth?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Don't say that too loudly! Tyler's always listening
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Our flag is as good of a flag as Waterslide Park is a name of a Micronation
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Fair
Good comeback
wait waterslide
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's hard to tell.
They shouldn't even be in any real war to begin with, it seems to not deal with them, however I digress.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
If the claim of them declaring religious war is true, I oppose.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Also decorum.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Sorry.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's alright.
Anyways, I am going to allot 5 minutes for delegates who wish to add anything about memberships or just plainly about their nation.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Soyuzist Republic is working on gathering intelligence on a local extremist group known as Nadim al Maghrebi, who were active in 2006 against the spanish cities of Ceuta and melilla. If they have been spotted near our territory, we may need to intervene somehow for national safety.
The YPM is currently gathering data.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That's great.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Last weekend, Waterside Green Council met with the Department for Agriculture and the Environment and the Royal Office in order to discuss new ways to tackle the growing issue of litter in Waterside Park.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Are we doing another readoing on Cimbrun?
apologies for the random comment
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills has had an attempted coup d'&#233;tat last night.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Sorry to hear that.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
A lieutenant general in the Revolutionary Army seized power of Ponderosa Hills for approximately two minutes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia has entered into its October 2021 general election, which will see the first First Minister elected in Aenopia's history.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Here is footage from the event.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Harrowing.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Deep.
Anyways, with that I am closing out this session!
It was starting off short but got better at the end of the session.
With that I ask members to take chatter to the appropriate channels.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Of course, I'll help you setup the server and I'll teach you how to start/stop/fix stuff.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I've been using Google Cloud. They offer one free VM, so funding shouldn't be an issue.
I have multiple VMs so they charge me roughly $2/mo per VM.

The session was concluded 13 hours ago. Please move to an appropriate venue.

The 136th session is an Asian and Oceanic Sess...</div>
The first on the agenda is the confirmation of Mr. Thorin Neal as the Minister of American Affairs.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Ovrestlia is present
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is briefly present.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I shall strongly support the appointment. Mr. Neal CUP is the best pick for the position and has served in the same capacity in the previous administration.
The floor is open for discussion.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I would support the appointment.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Mr Neal has shown himself to be a professional and reliable Minister in my tenure. There are few people that I would trust more than Thorin to assume the mantle once more.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Tesforia is present.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
So would I
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I too would support the appointment of Mr. Neal.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you. 
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
None here.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
I have nothing to add
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
We shall move on.
&amp; Mr. Lewis, and the Lieutenant Chair on the issue while I was away last week.
The floor is open.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
I don’t really see a need to acquire it.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
What is MicroNear?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
It is a project run by Berry Empire regarding the location of various micronations.
It basically helps locating your nearby micronations.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Here’s a link to it.
Micronear</div>
Micronation list &amp; nearby micronation finder</div>
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
It’s very interesting. But I feel we should allow them to operate on their own.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I agree.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The project would most likely be shut down if it doesn’t find a new host.
We aren’t stealing micronear, it was offered to the CA because the owner wants to focus on other things.
Brennan Sullivan - Tesforia: 
Oh, I understand now. If it means keeping the project alive then I am in favor of it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Like I said last session though, we shouldn’t take it on if we can’t guarantee we can keep it going, and that includes the funding that would be needed.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I change my vote to aye.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Not much solution towards funding other than donations was offered though.
The owner of the project though did offer to help teach us some of the basics of managing it, and the funding would only be about $2 a month.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I have always objected to the use of money in all such micronational projects. The spending of $2 would mean that either it has to be collected from the member-nations as the alliance's fund is basically Jayden Lycon's personal savings.
No matter if the amount is very less or very high, money is money.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well unless the CA can provide its own independent hosting, there’s not much to do to avoid the cost.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Has the project been helpful at all?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What do you mean? It serves its function well I would say.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
Yeah, I agree
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It does pretty much what it set out to do, put Micronations on a map and let people near to those nations see how far they are.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But that would also mean, people putting their exact locations publicly.
As most of the nations mainly claim residences, etc
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That’s the issue Mr. Lewis brought up and it was rectified and a warning was added.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am not against the acquisition, but I shall be against the spending of money, etc
Does anyone have anything to add more to the topic?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
If we aren’t going to spend money on it we shouldn’t acquire it.
There no point to acquiring it if we are just going to let it go offline.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I am late, but present(the soyuzist republic)
What did I miss?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Not much, you can give a brief reading.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
So, we are thinking of acquiring micronear?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It was offered to us.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I dont see the point in it, seeing that you can already publicly add your own micronation to the list.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It allows you to see what Micronations are close to you.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Indeed, but whats the point in us specifically acquiring it?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It prevents the project from going offline.
This has already been discussed.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am afraid, if I can find any nation located near to me.
The nearest one will be 1900 kms away.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That’s unfortunate.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I have been much interested into the project and nor will be.
Anyways, shall we move on?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don’t have anything else.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The next on the agenda are the membership attainment discussions.
The first reading of Avalonia.
Remarks - Republic of Avalonia</div>
Membership Application Remarks  22 October 2021  Application Information  Name of Applicant: Republic of Avalonia Name(s) of proposed delegate(s): James II Applied on: 16/10/2021  Basic Information  Date of Foundation: 13 August 2021 Location: Chicago, United States Citizen...</div>
I shall strongly support Avalonia's becoming a member. The nation may be new but it is professional. All my interactions with its leader have been healthy.
The floor is open for discussion.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
From what I have seen, they seem like they would be fine members.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does anyone have anything further to add on their application?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I dont have anything further.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The next application is of the Kingdom of Terrerite (Second reading). 
Remarks - Kingdom of Terrerit&#233;</div>
Membership Application Remarks  22 October 2021  Application Information  Name of Applicant: Kingdom of Terrerit&#233; Name(s) of proposed delegate(s): Ignis Audeladroit I Applied on: 12/10/2021  Basic Information  Date of Foundation: 6 February 2021 Location: Chile Citizenship...</div>
I shall also be supportive of their application.
The floor is open for discussion.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I will also support their admission.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The next is the second reading of the application of Cimbrun
Remarks - Hellenistic Empire of Cimbrun</div>
Membership Application Remarks  15 October 2021  Application Information  Name of Applicant: Hellenistic Empire of Cimbrun Name(s) of proposed delegate(s): Alexander Burke Applied on: 08/10/2021  Basic Information  Date of Foundation: 2019 Location: United States Citizensh...</div>
I shall abstain on their application as they have fluctuated on being professional and such.
The floor is open
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
The Monmarkian Empire is present briefly. I oppose this application wholeheartedly.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
This good to see Monmark being present.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Cimbrun's leader is wildly unprofessional, not to mention my concerns over his restraint around minors.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What do you mean by that?
I can’t claim to be fully knowledgeable on the situation.
Also, why do the remarks still lack the safeguarding officer’s signature?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Those were present by Mr. Xia last week as well, I was on break around that time.
However, I shall inform all that the Safeguarding Officer had duly conducted his own investigation and approved that the leader of Cimbrun is fit to be a delegate.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
I shall abstain from making public what happened.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Alright, so the lack of a signature is a clerical error.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Right. I shall direct the Safeguarding Officer to make his report public.
Alexander I Constantine-Monmark: 
Nevertheless, I have worries.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
So do I.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
I do not support the application of Cimbrun
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The leader of Cimbrun had proven to be unprofessional especially extending their support to Harold O'Duighan.
And trying to undermine Adammia
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
The emperor has abused speechly people on Discord (privately)
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Does anyone have anything more to add?
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
If you wish, I have evidence of the harassment
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
rr is present!
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Please privately address those to me.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Please avoid abbreviations.
The next is the second reading of Sonderan.
Remarks - Triumvirate of Sonderan</div>
Membership Application Remarks  15 October 2021  Application Information  Name of Applicant: Triumvirate of Sonderan Name(s) of proposed delegate(s): Cedar Applied on: 10/10/2021  Basic Information  Date of Foundation: 2018 Location: United States Citizenship: 25 (as per M...</div>
I shall strongly support the application of Sonderan.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
The hosting is pretty much free. I just thought it could help the CA as lots of micronations use the app.
But, of course, it's also a responsibility. I don't really want to give the project to someone untrustworthy.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
You can opt out of sharing both, the location of your micronation and the distance from users.
Any questions?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Your opinion on Sonderan?
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Highly professional. Their leader is the Safeguarding Officer of the GUM.
Does anyone have anything else to add on the topic before we move to adjourn the session?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don’t have anything.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As none has anything else to add, I shall wait for 10 minutes before adjourning the session.
Members may opt this time to present national reports.
Election notification was effective in Vishwamitra on the 21 October 2021 with the serving government resigning. A caretaker government under the premiership of Phillip Joseph Pillin was formed with three other ministers, which shall remain in charge until the elections are over and replaced by a full-time government.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is going to be releasing a minor peerage system in the coming days which will see the incorporation of three new small territories made up of land held by some of the titles. The land being incorporated will be treated the same way as baronies are treated but with slightly more land attributed to them.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Session adjourned to meet again at 19:00 UTC for the European-African Session.
Ezri Ambriz: 
I won’t be here in this hour I will be at church
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

I concur with the delegate from Desert District.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I apologize for essentially packing the floor with Ponderosan delegates, but I support Mr. Neal in the highest way possible.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's OK!
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
We love Ponderosa!
James B. - Desert District: 
We’re not GUM after all.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I have known Mr. Neal for years, and I know that he will be a very valuable and efficient member of the Cabinet.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I concur with the main delegate for Ponderosa Hills.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Are there any further comments on this confirmation?
If not let's move on to the second topic on the agenda.
The acquisition of Micronear by the Cupertino Alliance.
Micronear (<a href="https://micronear.bloomflare.dev/)">https://micronear.bloomflare.dev/)</a> is an online platform that maps micronations globally.
Micronear</div>
Micronation list &amp; nearby micronation finder</div>
The floor is open.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Acquisition?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yes.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Will the CA buy it?
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I believe that Micronear is a fascinating idea and I am glad we are acquiring it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The project was offered to us due to the owner wanting to move on to other things.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Oh well then that's fantastic
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe it will be free, apart from domain costs, however this can be moved onto the main domain to save costs, I suppose?
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
Although I don't support the idea of buying it for actual currency.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think it would be good for us to manage the project
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The main issue is ensuring it stays online.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We are not paying anything for it.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
That could do.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I propose a committee be created to manage the Micronear website and its assets.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Costs to maintain it separate.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
And if that was the plan I don't see any problem with it
But since it's not tat's even better
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
As the Minister for Technology, I believe I would be responsible for it, and I'm happy to take on the costs of hosting for the foreseeable future.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Would moving it to a different server remove the need for the cost?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Possibly.
do you have any comments?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe the owner said that it would be two USD a month for its something I forget the word.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I can host it on my server
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I believe it would be best if a small group of people manage it.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Yes -
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur with the honourable delegate from Ponderosa Hills.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I'd like to mention that it's pretty much cost free
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
To restate, I believe a CA committee be created to manage the assets of the Micronear website.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
How much is it then?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I feel like if Redberry has been able to manage it by himself, that would be a bit unnecessary.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Google Cloud offers one free VM. But I'm paying 2$/mo as I have multiple VMs.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It could easily fall under the Minister of Technology.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well the one free VM was kinda left out before, that would have made discussion of funding a bit easier.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
By VM do you mean Virtual Machine?
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I see. Sorry for not bringing it up earlier.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Yes
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
If we acquire it, I can dedicate a VM to it on my server
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
That'd be great! Especially because New Athens is an established and trustworthy micronation.
I'll teach you how to start/stop the server and that's basically it
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That would be great
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic:

Larry Martin - Waterside Park:

Fairly new.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
That's just a tutorial on how to power on/shut down a virtual PC.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
The wiki looks pretty professional.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
We'll come back to that after everything else on the agenda is done.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Tho it is new, im all for giving them a chance
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would be willing to give them a chance as an observer.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I concur.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
If they have all the features of a 6 month old nation, that's perfectly adequate.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Alright.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe I've had a couple short discussions with their leader on the MW@D server, and they were very friendly and professional. I would support their entrance into the alliance as an observer and as a full member later on.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Brilliant.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Are there any further comments?
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I concur.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I'll be away for a couple of minutes just to note
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Understood.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I wouldn't say they have all the features of a 6 month old nation
I'll be abstaining.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
That's a little concerning, then.
Thanks for bringing that to our attention.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Well to be honest, our nation hasnt fully divided ministerial duties either.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
If there's no further discussion, we'll move on.

Ah i believe we have had this ome before yes?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Well, I've seen the screenshots.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What was the reason we decliend them again?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
And I've seen their delegates conduct after the altercation.
So it's a no from me.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
No.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What is the great micronational war?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
In my experience, recently, their leader's conduct has improved.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Don't mention it
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
Contrary to the report on them, I believe they are a massive safeguarding hazard.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Is this the same war?

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
No
I am disappointed to see how Cimbrun threw away its potential so miserably in the span of 3 years
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
The leader has said some quite sexual things to a mentally challenged man.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
They are not the same war.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
So I vote Nay.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Qaflana is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Noted.
Is there any further discussion?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Also noted.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
To shorten it, it is the given name by certain people who are still very invested in the incident, of many conflicts across individuals in a group of people either voluntarily or involuntarily, and the nations they represented which coincided around the same time between July and September 2019
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
All I can say is that they haven't matured.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Exactly
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
If there's no further discussion, let's move on.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
A no from me.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What was it about even?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I will tell you in private if you want.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Let's move on now.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic:

Triumvirate of Sonderan</div>
Sonderan, officially the Triumvirate of Sonderan, is a small, self-declared country, commonly known as a micronation, founded on 5 January 2018 on the Mornington Peninsula in Victoria, Australia. A secular, constitutional triumvirate, the nation has three, ostensibly equal, heads of state known as 'the Triumvirs'.
The floor is open.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What does it mean to be a triumvirate?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Three equal heads of state.
Think of it a bit like a triarchy.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Ah alright.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I am in support of them.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is present x
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm saying yes. They're professional, they have a lovely flag, they're progressive, and they're experienced.

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
They would be an extremely welcome addition to the Alliance.

Cimbrun has returned from hiatus as of May 24th, 2021 (Thargelion 13th, 699th Olympiad 4th year.) The LIN was extremely welcoming, and many allies have been recovered as a result. The return from hiatus occured following support of the Basileus after being cancelled by the Cupertino Alliance, who saw a slanderous screenshot and decided to ban the nation from the server.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Please may we stay on topic?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would definitely be in support of admitting Sonderan.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
They seem lovely, I vote in favor of their addition.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Is there any further discussion regarding Sonderan?
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I vote aye.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
If there's no further discussion, let's move onto the next point in the agenda.

Kingdom_of_Terrerit%C3%A9</div>
The floor is open.
It's a no from me.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Nice flag
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No from me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Partially due to the dance mother, partially due to the official furry persona. Fursona, if you will.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The dance moms thing was explained. A member of it accepted a title, which the nation used for publicity. It's not that big of a deal breaker.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What now?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Picrew imagery, it will be a no for me.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It just seems disingenuous to present them so boldly as if they are involved in the nation's day-to-day governance.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Do they?
The article seems fairly honest about their position.
Just members of the Terrerit&#233; nobility. I don't get the impression of full-time government member from that.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That's a pretty flimsy reason to say no.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
If I'm being honest, I'm mainly concerned with this abomination:
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
A piece of fanart from someone on twitter is your main reason for saying no?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Indeed, it is honestly just a personal opinion.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I hate it too but you shouldn't honestly base your professional opinion on that
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That probably isn't a fair thing to levy.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
They seemingly made it official.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
And?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I see no issue with them.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
This whole thing seems more like a social attention-grab more than a micronation to me.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't think so. It's fanart.
If I drew a piece of art like that for Waterside Park we wouldn't kick you out.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It would be short-sighted to immediately shoot down this application - they almost certainly have promise to me, but they are not ready for membership right now in my opinion.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Why's that? And I do appreciate that this seems like much fairer reason to be opposed.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I don't like the furry stuff either but shooting down an application because you don't like the way they conduct their PR is mindless
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
It says one of their main religioms is LaVeyan satanism, what does that entail?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Unless you know, it's something actually worth looking into.
Ezri Ambriz: 
I am concerned
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It links to a wikipedia article.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
LaVeyan Satanism involves the practice of magic, which encompasses two distinct forms; greater and lesser magic. Greater magic is a form of ritual practice and is meant as psychodramatic catharsis to focus one's emotional energy for a specific purpose. These rites are based on three major psycho-emotive themes: compassion (love), destruction (hate), and sex (lust). Lesser magic is the practice of manipulation by means of applied psychology and glamour (or wile and guile) to bend an individual or situation to one's will.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Doesn't really have anything to do with their political competence either so I suggest we stay relevant.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
It could though.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
No
It's just a belief
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It's gonna be a bad precedent if we start judging people's competency based on their religious beliefs.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Many nations get beliefs and politics entwined.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Which is what concerns me
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Refer to this
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Due to Moroccan law, the Soyuzist republic cannot show support to micronations whom heavily support are are in contact with witchcraft and satanic groups.
Well, we can't really show support to the ideas.
Persecutions have happened in Morocco.
And scrutinisation by the public is frequent.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Interesting.
I guess you could always abstain.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
We do not want to risk being on a watchlist of the Mokhabarat, and thus will show no support if they are found to harbor the ideas heavily within their nation.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
It seems we are attempting to ostracize somebody here just because of their visual symbolism and beliefs. Correct me if I'm wrong and by all means I hope I am.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Indeed.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
A few things worth noting too:
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The wikipedia article literally says Practitioners do not believe that Satan literally exists and do not worship him.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Kingdom_of_Terrerit%25C3%25A9#Democracy_Index">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Kingdom_of_Terrerit%C3%A9#Democracy_Index</a>
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Population would prefer stronger leadership
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Low degree of freedom, and they show that a large chunk of their population show support of witchcraft. It will be a no from us.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I see. It’s a no from me.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
All that and they want stronger leadership.
First off, how could it be much stronger. Second off, we shouldn't wish for someone to have something they don't want.
Weird
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
<strong>The next 12 minutes will be open for general discussion of the session, including points from earlier in the agenda.</strong>
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I concur. A great micronation.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There's a lot of odd contradictions in their policies that I wouldn't expect.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We're we done with the applicant?
It seemed like discussion was still on going.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It'd slowed down, but you are still free to discuss Terrerit&#233;.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
A last call for comments would have been nice is all.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
They have a nice website, a (relatively) popular instagram page and seem well-developed.
I support their observership
Yet their microwiki page says something about satanism. Not sure how is it meant.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Monmark is present, and I apologise for my tardiness.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Noted.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I concur.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Oh yes
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Their nation has been involved in some minor drama, and all sides handled it very poorly.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Cimbrun has returned from hiatus as of May 24th, 2021 (Thargelion 13th, 699th Olympiad 4th year.) The LIN was extremely welcoming, and many allies have been recovered as a result. The return from hiatus occured following support of the Basileus after being cancelled by the Cupertino Alliance, who saw a slanderous screenshot and decided to ban the nation from the server.
Apparently we cancelled them.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
It would appear that they have already decided what they think of us, and what we should think of them.
Seeing their past and present behaviour, which mind you isn't always a good predictor of future behaviour, I think it is more than fair to say that they would not be sporting member.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
If there's no further discussion, I'll allocate the next 5 minutes to national reports.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Burdette is no longer present.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is no longer present.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Research has been done by the YPM of the Soyuzist Republic. So far our research team has recently contacted the website responsible for storing data on the terrorist organisation known as Nadim al Maghrebi(or the Shame of Morocco). Their group operates in cells of approximately 10-15 men who each either perform suicide attacks, or armed attacks using small arms. They seem to be connected to the large terror confederation of AQIM. They are an active group we have had no visual contact with them on the mountain but our national guard is on high alert.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania experienced a deadly hail storm, the worst natural disaster to hit our shores since the 2019 Cyclone. 
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm sorry to hear that.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Well its more of a positive change, we now know how they operate.
They perform constant small arms attacks to cause the fall of melila.
A war of attrition in a sence.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Notwithstanding, that is still rather terrifying.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Of course, but our community will relay any information gathered as fast as possible.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Aren't they a division of ISIS?
Hope they don't reach you.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I am sure I am not alone when I say this, nor would I be the first, but god speed.
James B. - Desert District: 
And?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Satanism is usually rather childish.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There was further discussion on the Satanism thing above that comment.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
If there's no further discussion, I hereby adjourn the session at 20 hours and 12 minutes Universal Co-ordinated Time. Please move any discussions to other venues.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
We are not.

Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hello everyone, and welcome to the 138th session of the Cupertino Alliance. We don't have a lot this session so let's just get into it.
Here is our agenda. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vn0_Hn7GRUibHQ9G02gzXqHgz2UneLyX/edit">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1Vn0_Hn7GRUibHQ9G02gzXqHgz2UneLyX/edit</a>
138th Session Agenda.docx</div>
THE CUPERTINO ALLIANCE 138th SESSION AGENDA4TH PARLIAMENT, 138th SESSIONAmerican Session30 October 2021 at 22:00 UTC  The following document is the official agenda and the associated resources of the  4th Parliament session. The 138th session is an American Session scheduled to be hosted...</div>
First we have a Act on establishing the Cupertino Alliance LGBTQ+ Association    
<a href="https://lgbtq.cupertinoalliance.com/act/CUPERTINOLGBTQ.pdf">https://lgbtq.cupertinoalliance.com/act/CUPERTINOLGBTQ.pdf</a>
Here is the act.
Do you want to go in-depth with the act?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
OK
The Act, if passed, would establish an LGBTQ+ Association to support members of the CA who also identify with the LGBTQ+ community.
The Association would have a separately elected Chair from the alliance, and membership would be open to anyone.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Humberlea is present.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I support it.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Furthermore, it would also support LGBTQ+ rights within member states and encourage widespread adoption of these rights.
tech: 
Northway is present.
MTonna257: 
Disagree
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think it is a great step for the alliance, and will help members who associate as LGBTQ+ feel safe.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I support it as well.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
What point would this serve?
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
I am personally gay, but as a representative of Terrerit&#233; I must disagree with that motion as it goes against no discrimination, we should no make differences based on sexual orientation.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Membership will be open to observer delegates as well?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
How does it make a difference?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
tech: 
I support it.
MTonna257: 
I concur
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I support it.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
As it's a dependent agency, I believe not.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think it is supposed to add support for people who align that way.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It says in the legislation.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I fully support this act.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
How will we go about protecting LGBTQ+ CA members?
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Because people not part of the LGBTQ+ community as myself, won't be able to be a chairman in this special form that is proposed.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Who said you can't?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It’s open to all delegates.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Full*
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
&#167;4 Leadership
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
You couldn’t because you are an observer delegate, not because you don’t associate with it.
tech: 
I concur.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I will vote nay. We don’t need more bureaucracy
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Sure, but I don't see the need for this being an official wing of the CA. I think that it would be perfect if an organization like this was sponsored by the CA, and not an official wing of it.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I concur.
MTonna257: 
I concur
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Over time, this will become an independent agency.
That's how they work in the CA.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If I recall, there are provisions in the charter for dependent agencies. Perhaps this would be a more.. suitable form for this group?
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We don’t really have a bureaucratic issue I believe.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
1. The LGBTQ+ Association Act aims to establish an LGBTQ+ Association for the
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
What exactly would this being a dependent agency entail?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Pushing this aside to avoid “bureaucracy” is pretty unfair.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
We don’t need this, this place already has defended LGBT people. We don’t need a whole organization for it.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
Well then, lets do it even more.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
A member state’s prime minister was using slurs a few days ago.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah that helps me support it even more.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
We don’t need a whole new organization for this.
MTonna257: 
I never saw an LGBTQ person being bullied here at least when I entered
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
I don't think it's fair. I don't want to be looked as need of special protection, nor have special treatment for my sexual orientation.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That’s great for you!
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
In fairness, the Cupertino Alliance does have serious bureaucratic problems with regards to the ministries and the courts, but it's wholly unrelated to this act— which may I add, as a dependent agency, affects this very little. As far as I recall, the CESE and other bodies have not caused any issues.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Sadly the rest of the world isn’t there.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Inactivity in them is what I’ve seen mostly. Not people being unable to get things done because of them existing.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Essentially, it receives some support from the CA to get started and over the next few months, it slowly becomes independent.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Pontunia does not involve in any affairs of the LGBT community.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Maybe, there should be an special session with only LGBTQ members and ask there if we want this new organization, with that answer we would put it up for general voration.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
Yeah, because you hate gays.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Oh, so it wasn’t bureaucracy that was the problem.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Now that’s exclusionary.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I do not hate gays
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
OK, let's not jump to conclusions.
MTonna257: 
We follow suit
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Curious.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Don't get involved in the body then.
Simple as.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Stop with the arguing.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The two who don’t involve in the community claim it’s too much bureaucracy.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
As true as that may be, please retain decorum in the session hall.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
You too Logan.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Which Logan?
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
True, I sincerely apologize for breaking decorum.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Medlin
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Medlin
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Duly noted.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Why? If we want it we put it to general votation on a session and if we don't want it we just don't discuss about it
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
It discriminates against non-lgbt
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
In what ways?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
How?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
How?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's important to note:
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This exactly.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Mr. Perdomo was referring to the session with only LGBTQ+ members.
Which would be exclusionary against non LGBTQ+ members.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
The entire premise of this body is to serve as a opt-in body.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia is present (1st delegate)
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
Elaborate.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The fact that this is such a issue makes me believe we should have the agency even more.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I concur 100%
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Concur with the delegate from Qaflana
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
That makes sense, then.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Since when did being lgbtq+ affect anything regarding the CA
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I would feel welcomed (As a bisexual man)
MTonna257: 
Going to have to stop you here: any sexualities can enter, then what's the point of creating another splinter group?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
When member state prime ministers started using slurs.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Pontunia will neither condemn nor support a LGBT organization.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The SR is late, but present.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Concur. Why is this an issue? This was specifically geared towards LGBT delegates on LGBT topics.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
To promote protections of the community.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The SR can legally not show support for any lgbt organisation.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
And to promote LGBTQ+ rights within member states.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Why can't we sanction people who say slurs now? Shouldn'r that be already covered?
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
then this first thing to do is state nothing about it
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
But we don't have to nessisarily condemn one either.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
In fairness, the prime minister of Monmark is not a member of the CA.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Another point of contention is the recent issue with regards to the comments of the Safeguarding Officer.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
concur
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Monmark is.
MTonna257: 
What did he say?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
And their delegates allowed it.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
There's a controversial piece of legislation which has been adopted by a few member states here which prohibits that. It's a discussion for another time.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I said the prime minster, not the King.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I know. It’s still the head of a member state.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Yes, their PM isn't though
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
If I had someone in the KNO preaching racism you guys wouldn’t say “well they aren’t a delegate”
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
freedom of speech is good, yes I can support that but you must always draw a line.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We are starting to get off topic about booting Monmark.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would actually like to propose a ban an all future Montediszamble Signatories from being accepted into the CA. I know a number of members here have discussed it.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I am strongly opposed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The topic on hand is the LGBTQ sector of alliance.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Then we should make this a priority and once it is done see how everything evolves
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe it’s relevant context as to why it’s needed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
If we wish to talk about it I can propose it.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
concur.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
Concur.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What about them exactly?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah but we were getting in territory of just Monmark.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Alongside my proposal with regards to the Individual Veto, I would like to table another motion later on in the session.
MTonna257: 
Then should I be booted out?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The legislation that’s on the agenda.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<a href="https://lgbtq.cupertinoalliance.com/act/CUPERTINOLGBTQ.pdf">https://lgbtq.cupertinoalliance.com/act/CUPERTINOLGBTQ.pdf</a>
MTonna257: 
I never spoke against anyone
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
“On all future”
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The proposed association would aim to encourage signatories to remove their signatures from it and have internal legislation regarding the freedom of speech instead. The whole idea of an association has been on the table since August.
MTonna257: 
Noted
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Pontunia is planning on signing.
tech: 
I concur (this may contradict earlier statements outside of the session but after close inspection I have changed my mind)
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Furthering our point of it’s true intention.
MTonna257: 
The Monte convention?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Yes.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
So the point is to offer protection for lgbt members of the CA correct?
Thats a main point at least
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes.
MTonna257: 
We're already signatories
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, and provide a safe space of such.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Protection against what exactly?
MTonna257: 
Autocorrect...
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Verbal abuse for starters.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Discrimination.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Slurs and hate in wake of the Monmark stuff.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Any issue that’s being faced.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Monmark stuff?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
And more.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I am not sure I follow.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not just that, a lot more.
MTonna257: 
Can someone send a MicroWiki article or Pictures...?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Monmark had some controversy, but I think we should probably discuss that after the session.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Of what?
MTonna257: 
The monmark issue
Never saw see anything, so I'm don't  know what I'm condemning
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I stand with monmark. Blame the person, not the nation
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
How could they be protected againsts slurs through an organisation though?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It's the head of the nation.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I don't see how that would work.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
And?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It would push for legislation and changes.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Within where?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Member states.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I stand with monmark. Blame the person, not the nation
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
And how would this push be enacted?
MTonna257: 
What does trannie even Mean???
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Campaigning and lobbying.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
Apologies for my absence.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Transexual
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's a slur against transgender people.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes I know Putin threw a baby off the building and the Russians did nothing about it but I stand with Russia.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
A slur for a transgender person.
tech: 
I think the PM of Monmark should be barred from being a delegate of Monmark.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I don’t care.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Slur regarding transgender individuals
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Lobbying?
I haven't heard of that term.
MTonna257: 
An abbreviation... Understood.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
You always don't care when it conveniently lines up with something being against the community.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
at all.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
No, not an abbreviation.
A slur.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
seek to influence (a legislator) on an issue.
MTonna257: 
Understood
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Banning anyone who signed the document from applying to join seems flawed, cause then you might have applications from people like Melite who are doing and saying nothing controversial.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's like how calling a gay man a homo isn't an abbreviation, it's instead a term used to cause offence.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
So the group kind of, pokes members not supportive of lgbt rights with a stick untill they accept those rights within their nation?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
That's one way to put it, I suppose.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I don't see how that could work.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Also they kept misgendering her.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
What is this organization for?
MTonna257: 
Seems dictatorial. Nobody likes being constantly poked at.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Do you believe this organization can do good?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's also there to put pressure on the administration to be extremely cautious with keeping tabs on the track records of LGBTQ+ rights foir applicants and current members.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Seems dictatorial. Nobody likes being constantly poked at.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
That’s what the LGBT organization would do. Lobby against some nations, including mine, despite Pontunia being non discriminatory
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I'm not sure honestly.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
You don't have to join?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
It doesn't have the means.
From what I see.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
I just can't think why all the process, laws and procedures that we actually have can't do the same as it is beign now proposed. 
MTonna257: 
My thoughts exactly
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Thats the thing; they seem to do this because they think it triggers the libs or some dumb motive. They dont want to do something as simple as refer to an individual properly because it they think it's funny.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
If you are non discriminatory you don't have to worry?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Technically my micronation cannot offer any legal protection against discrimination towards lgbt members, cause that would be illegal and could land the entire community on a watchlist with the mokhabarat.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Our nation has a history of being condemned for discrimination.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Why?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
How could this organisation fix that?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Our nation has a history of being condemned for discrimination.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
If you changed then great?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wonder why..
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I did.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Then the discrimination criticism will cede.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
It honestly has not.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
There's no smoke without fire Andrew.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
If your organisation could fix this i would be more interested, but for now I dont see that it has the means to perform its goal adequately.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Let it exist and you'll see it work towards fixing it.
You can't criticize it for something you haven't allowed it to do.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
How though?
Is there any plan?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Through legislation in the CA pushing for changes, changes in the CA itself.
MTonna257: 
Solidarity.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Again, can't criticize something it hasn't been allowed to do.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
You're telling me the CA is going to change the law of Morocco.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Solidarity for discriminating against people?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Solidarity.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We aren't dealing with Morocco.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I switch my position on banning all future members of the Montediszamble convention.
MTonna257: 
Not at all
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Then for what?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
did you read my message?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
The thing is if you can't stand to be associate with anything LGBTQ goes immediately against our mission and is talk for debate.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
You can always abstain.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I clearly said we cannot offer protection against discrimination of lgbt individuals, for that would break Moroccan law.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">Members of the Cupertino Alliance shall promote these values:
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Heck, I think it is grounds for expulsion under the Charter.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't believe the law of Morocco also says you must vehemently argue against it.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I dont see how just repeatedly telling people to change is going to work.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
It does not.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We could implement punitive measures.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
but you cant offer legal protection from them either.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Take voting rights, not allow delegates to be ministers.
MTonna257: 
I concur
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I think it's just expulsion really.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
You don't represent Morocco here.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Theres a reason theres only one lgbt organisation allowed to function witbin Morocco, all others were outlawed and  Kif-Kif was forced to print their papers in spain.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
If we expel then we can't encourage change.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I represent the Soyuzist Republic, which is situated within Morocco.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is no longer present.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Do you really think I can get away with breaking Moroccan law?
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
I think we are now walking in circles. Maybe we should close up and vote
MTonna257: 
Is your law based on Morocco's law?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Do you understand how this organization works?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Pontunia has done a lot to improve the rights of LGBT people, and we are still shunned.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This is fictional nations.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Wendatia's first delegate is no longer present
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
They are monitoring your discord making sure you aren't supporting the LGBT?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well you certainly aren't doing anything to improve that here.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
You do know the Soyuzist republic has physical land, right?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Wonderful.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
I do, but there is nothing new been said here, it's a waste of time now. Everyone has explained their opinions
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
And its expanding in december.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I believe it may be high time to move to the next item on the agenda.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Probably.
Take the arguing to another channel.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Why even have sessions?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
For the most part we have to follow moroccan law to not get arrested and/or thrown on a list.
MTonna257: 
Understood
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Next we have confirming Thorin Neal as Minister of American Affairs.

Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I fully support this notion.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Basically.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I am abstaining from this vote
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr speaker may I have the floor?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I concur, you seem chill. @Thorin#7374
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Go ahead.

I abstain.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Thank you.

Abstain
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
I would go against it.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
I vote aye.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I fully support this act.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I fully support this notion.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur as well.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Of course you do, Minister-elect.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Who would you prefer to see in the role?
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Anyone who haven't bashed my nation in the past.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Mr. Neal is extremely experienced and well-organised, and would do well in this role.
Ah, personal reasons.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
A shame observers can't vote.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What wss it bashed for?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Under the second administration, I was the leading force on American sessions.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I find your conduct in-session to be rather unprofessional.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Not personal, bashed my nation, not myself.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Sertor you've taken yourself out of the running for American minister now.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That's fair.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I will change my vote to against.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Defending my nations interests is not unprofessional.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Them being minister wouldn't really go against your national interests.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Why's that?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I feel that sertor would be better.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Sertor is located in England.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Please kindly think that through for a minute.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
. All matter of opinion I guess.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Should we move on?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Sertor is european by the way.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Well, Terrerit&#233; is an observer member since yesterday, therefore we have not been able to see your work, just your opinions on us. Maybe in some time we will change our mind, but for now, the vote is already said.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Said.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah I'm alright with that.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think we can move on.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright let's move on to the membership reading time.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Mr speaker?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
What?
We have our first reading for the United Phoenix Empire of Haskaria.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
If I recall, I tabled a motion with you with regards to the Individuals Veto Act.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Aren't they voted against?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Last time Haskaria applied, there was a safeguarding concern regarding sexual questions towards minors.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It applies to the individual, not the nation.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I'll go over it after this nation.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Duly noted.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana:

Here is their remarks.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I am strongly opposed to sexual affairs with minors.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
For the benefit of this session, could you recap the exact nature of this?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Their leader has been unprofessional and rather rude.
MTonna257: 
I talked with the Haskarian King, and he's a fun person. He's not bad

The United Phoenix Empire of Haskaria</div>
capital city: Jiyuu village of the Haskaria province
MTonna257: 
Never saw that rubbish happening
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It was a scientific survey aimed at the LGBTQ+ community. Questions included (not limited to) Do you have any unusual kinks and At what age did you discover pornography
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I hate to judge off of a microwiki page but, yeah.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Very poor wiki page aswell.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
... that is truly shocking.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I recall they rescinded their application after that came to light.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Why are they even being allowed to apply
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Correct.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That is very very weird.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What is a phoenix empire supposed to be?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's just the name.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Shouldn't the Safeguarding Officer have done their job?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It's the name.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Based on their national emblem.
MTonna257: 
Just a name
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
That’s deviant, and should be reported
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
This is true. It's my understanding that he didn't think it through and recalled the survey almost immediately.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What is?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Asking minors about when they found porn is very weird.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Actually it was up for many months.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
I mean they say they have 10 citizens but only theor government is more than 10 people, so, numbers don't make sense.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
No from me.
Anyone wish to add anything else before moving on?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
This is a no from me. This should have been executively rejected by the SO.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I concur.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
To play devil's advocate, the survey was anonymous and not targeted specifically to minors. I read the questions and it seemed like it was intended to be scientific but was poorly executed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Saying it's a accident doesn't excuse the fact.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Of course not, but it's important to have context in all situations.
MTonna257: 
I agree with their membership
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
It should be common sense to not ask people when they discovered porn.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Even after all that?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
They also seem to have some rather worrying views concerning the LGBTQ+ community as a whole.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Worrying.
Some of the questions on the survey I recall also being pretty loaded.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Like what?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Let me make sure i'm not saying anything wrong and check.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The survey has been removed now.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I know I was looking for discussion.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
You can add it at the end of the session or dm me if you cant make the end.
Moving on.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It seems to be removed anyways now, if I find it in the future i'll send it to you.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Ah, I believe this is my cue?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Next we have the use of the Individual Veto Act by Sertor.
Yes.

Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I clarify something?
It is a motion utilising the powers of said act.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is no longer present.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I strongly support.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I support aswell.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I support
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Terrerit&#233; Abstains.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I also support the motion.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wish to note I intend to invoke the powers of the Urgent Proposal Act, and have this motion voted on as soon as possible.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<div class="quote">It has been deleted temporarily. I plan on regulating it through an ID system that will ask for an ID proving one's age upon entering the server and, if one is sent that shows the user is 18+, allowing them access to the Saloon.
I'll put it up to vote after.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
The Basileus of Cimbirn has been a disgrace to her nation.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
His*
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Oh.
Apologies.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This is individual so we are only blacklisting Alexander.
Does anyone wish to add anything further before we move on?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Nothing from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Next we have the third reading for the Republic of Avalonia.

The Republic of Avalonia, more commonly known as Avalonia, is a sovereign micronation situated within the United States.

MTonna257: 
Support
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Support
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I, as do many members here, have a relationship with them within the Constantia Pact, where they have proven themselves to be professional, friendly, and active.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Do we still support the 6 month rule when applying?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
No. It is a development guideline nowadays
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
While I think it's great they are awfully new.
Oh alright.
Yeah I support them.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe now it's that applicants must have all the features of a 6-month old nation.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
They look young, but they are well prepared as long as I have seen. It is worth  to let them prove themselves.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Does anyone wish to add anything further?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Nothing from me.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Alright, I am now giving everyone 5 minutes of free discussion as you will, you can talk about news about your own nation or about a previous topic.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I support them
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
May I propose a motion?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Sure.
MTonna257: 
The Democratic Christian Republic of Melite had recently incorporated a Special Administrative Region named YeLand.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That's cool.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Wait why does Melite have two delegates as an observer?
MTonna257: 
YeLand's foreign policy is tied to Melite'd
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I would like to propose a ban on all future Montediszamble Convention signatories from applying to the Cupertino Alliance. 
MTonna257: 
Thank you
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Nadim al Maghrebi remains a possoble threat to the security of the Soyuzist republic. The recent elections have sparked a KO for the Jucheist party making it lose its final seat in the council, and making the PEC the full holder of seats in the council.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens signed a Mutual Recognition Treaty in-person with the Technocratic Republic of Theodia. This is the first in-person treaty signed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Hard to talk on this, I don't know why though.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
How so?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I don't know.
MTonna257: 
Both Delegates for the Democratic Christian Republic of Melite will not be present. Goodnight and many thanks.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Goodnight.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Goodnight.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would support this motion. There is no reason to sign the convention, when internal laws could be just as easily enacted, without supporting transphobia and systemic discrimination against the LGBTQ+ community. I am also very pleased to hear that Vishwamitra may be removing its signature.
MTonna257: 
Thanks, it's 1:08 here
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah I support it too.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
4pm over here.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Hear hear.
I intend on preparing a proper document for this motions second and third reading, in future sessions.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I believe this could count as a first reading.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
It sure looks like it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well since the 5 minutes are up I am closing out this session.
MTonna257:

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support this act.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I fully support this act.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I also support this act.
Signatures of the Montediszamble Convention by member states following 1 December 2021 are to however be considered grounds for automatic expulsion 
This is important.
What are your thoughts?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support that section.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I’m not very informed on the history of the convention. Could someone please fill me in?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I support this as well.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Essentially, it's a convention on free speech and anti-cancel culture written to try and stop blame being given to Yaroslav Mar over his transphobic comments.
It's not inherently a bad convention, but the signatories are essentially supporting systemic discrimination.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Montediszamble_Convention">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Montediszamble_Convention</a>

Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I was blind at the moment, and Dhrub told me to sign it, which I did.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Terrerit&#233; is present.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Does anyone know what I need to do to not be part of it anymore?
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I would be in support of this act
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That article has its controversy section removed from it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
You apparently have to contact Yaroslov that you wish to be removed.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
I'm not sure if the CA has the authority to do this, but rather than expel nations who signed the convention outright, restrictions could be placed on their participation to coerce them to opt-out of the treaty.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Problematic.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yaroslav won't remove signatories.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Does opting out of the treaty need any official documents done?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Oh that's.. quite a problem. He would claim he has support from those nations that signed
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That’s a state by state basis I believe.
James B. - Desert District: 
I could not possibly support this act more.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Signatories should remove themselves then, it's all up to internal politics to decide.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The page is locked and for some reason he is one of the only people that can edit it.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
I don't know much about the convention, but couldn't a country just unilaterally remove itself from the treaty?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would absolutely be in support of this act, as there is absolutely no reason why the CA should be harbouring these signatory states - we have openly discussed the true reality behind the treaty time and time again, so there is no reason for any member to be a member and yet blind to its true meaning.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Yes
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I think making an official statement regarding the nation not following the treaty anymore is enough.. right?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I believe so. But yaroslov sets up roadblocks for that to be recognized.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Humberlea is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I believe so. But yaroslov sets up roadblocks for that to be recognized.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We’ve discussed the true purpose and history of it and some of our fellow member states then signed onto it.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">We’ve discussed the true purpose and history of it and some of our fellow member states then signed onto it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Knowing all the background and problems.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
It by all means should be
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Wouldn't that be an infringement on micronational sovereignty, though? If that's the case, it seems like the convention seeks to trap signatories by preventing them from opting out.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
These members clearly sign the treaty intentionally knowing its criticisms and have no place here as a result.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Signatories can opt out but publicly people can’t tell if they are still signed on as it’s difficult to get their signatures removed.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I think those that did not know deserve a second chance.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Are you joking, it would be an infringement on any sovereignty.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The act doesn’t remove current signatories, but encourages them to remove their support of it.
You would be fine.
Or Snagov I mean.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Phillip - Pibocip is present. Sorry for the delay
James B. - Desert District: 
Slightly is an understatement.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I would think of more member states outside my own, since I am completely responsible for my actions.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I think those that did not know deserve a second chance.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Right
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Of course.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
If anyone wishes to remove their signatures from the website, please contact me. Yaroslav has since left Discord, but I have him as a friend on Facebook.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Soyuzist Republic is present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think the deadline to sign should come into effect the moment this is ratified. We shouldn’t give people a grace period to sign if we are taking a stance against it.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
That's great and very kind of you!
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The current act allows people to sign up till December 1st and not be considered for automatic expulsion.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I'm a bit confused, what signing are we talking about?

Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I am strongly opposed to this.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Of course you would be.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
You are a recent signatory. But what are the exact reasons?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
One of the people who signed after hearing the history of it is opposed. Who would have guessed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
^^^
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
As long as current signatories are given time to remove their signature then I support this.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I geuss it doesn't really apply to our nation for we haven't signed it before.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Nothing happens to current signatories in this act except being encouraged to withdraw.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">As long as current signatories are given time to remove their signature then I support this.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
The treaty is fine, even if the people behind it aren’t the best
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That’s why Pontunia jumped at the chance to sign.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This should be a wake up call to all delegates.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
But being associated with them wouldn't be good
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Doesn’t really apply to us but I support the act
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">The treaty is fine, even if the people behind it aren’t the best
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Internal legislation can cover the things addressed in the treaty, there’s no reason to sign it after you heard about the background.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Especially this Yaroslav individual which is very controversial
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I actually think it’s a good treaty
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The treaty itself isn't the main issue, it's the history behind it and what it was really written for.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah, making treaties with Yaroslav is like playing with the devil.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The treaty does have problematic elements still.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
If it protects nations who say homophobic things, that’s horrible
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Like how it covers people saying things as long as it’s backed by their “religion”.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Especially on this act with it’s convictions in the first place.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
No matter how fringe or small, is an important note it includes.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
That’s freedom of opinion.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">That’s freedom of opinion.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
How so?
Rory - Lurdentania: 
Lurdentania is present
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
You can’t purge the world of evil
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
The funniest part about the treaty is that Yaroslav used a micronational treaty to cover up for calling people like me racial slurs.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We don’t have to further it.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Absolutely agree
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Freedom of opinion means you can have whatever opinion you want, but it doesn't mean you're free of consequences for having that opinion.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Was that part of his religion?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Racism isn't really a part of any religion.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Yeah.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Love thy neighbour.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
What if I use Bobism to let me be racist?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
But religious people can be racist because they are ignorant/stupid, not because of the religion
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">How so?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Are we still on the topic of the treaty?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Then you'd be protected under the convention.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That bit seems to be lost on many.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I’m not supporting everything yaro has done, but I stand with montedezamble
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Burdette is present by the way.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I guess so. We are still discussing it.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills will be signing shortly.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That’s about the thought process.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Disappointing.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I’m not supporting everything yaro has done, but I stand with montedezamble
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Well....
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Not everything
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
Not really.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
No
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">You are kind of forgetting the NOI exists <span class="mention" title="neon bible reader#6477">@Larry Martin - Waterside Park</span>
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Freedom of speech.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
What if I am racist to Italian’s because the man who convicted Jesus of treason was Italian?
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
I wish that I was Black enough to join the Nation of Islam.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I mean freedom of opinion right?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I have a hatred for the leadership of that group.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Decorum, please? Should we move on to the next thing on the agenda?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Truly.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
That's not being a good Muslim. That's being, frankly, a backwards organisation, that shares very few views that should be taken from the Qur'an
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think we should
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Elijah Muhammad did nothing wrong.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
If you are going to prohibit the CA from signing the convention, ban the NoI
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Agreed.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Move on.
Back and forth arguments.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Alright.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
We don't consider them muslims, they are considerd mortadin simple as that.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Next, we shall discuss on:
<a href="https://lgbtq.cupertinoalliance.com/act/CUPERTINOLGBTQ.pdf">https://lgbtq.cupertinoalliance.com/act/CUPERTINOLGBTQ.pdf</a>
Cupertino Alliance LGBTQ+ Association.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I would be in support of this act.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm a bit biased on this, but I think I support it.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I am in support of this act.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would also be in support of this.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I have to oppose due to legal reasons.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I am against it, not because I’m homophobic, but because it discriminates against non LGBT members of the organization
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
How?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It doesn’t.
Full support of this.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
To me?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Of course you are.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
No, to Andrew.
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
This sounds like a good idea.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
How so?
How is that discrimination? Anyone can join
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I am against it, not because I’m homophobic, but because it discriminates against non LGBT members of the organization
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
We don’t need another organization
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I cannot believe that it’s only legal reasons, you can always just not say anything.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Not say anything to?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The issue.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If it's legal reasons than you can just abstain.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
We
James Murray - Avalonia: 
That’s a bureaucratic issue, you just said it’s discriminatory. How does it discriminate?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
We can all live in harmony, protecting the rights of other individuals isn't getting rid of your own.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Theres a part in the act where it says the group wishes to spread lgbtq acceptance into member of the CA
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Which is illegal in morocco.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Yes, and the place does it enough to not require this
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
There's only one legal entity allowed to spread acceptance of LGBTQ+ and thats kif-kif
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
And yet, here you are.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Yes, and the place does it enough to not require this
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Any other group will be bopted off of the country
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Then just abstain Mr. Soyuz.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Booted*
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We’ve heard this multiple times already.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Many of these arguments do feel as if we're going in circles sometimes.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
If that’s the case you shouldn’t really be in Micronationalism at all, there is many LGBT entities and such.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Yeah. Most people agree, and then we start arguing because some don't.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
True.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Its not the fact that im around people who have support of it, its the fact that homosexuality is illegal and the spreading of acceptance for the most part is too.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I imagine I would be arguing with Andrew because of his far right views.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
So if a group were to attempt to spread acceptance into our area, that would be illegal.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I’m not far right
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
And could catch us a list with the Mokhabarat
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Well you act like it.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
There is only one organisation legally allowed to spread acceptance, Kif-Kif
James Murray - Avalonia: 
So if this act passes you would have to leave the CA?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I am from Romania, a place where all LGBT individuals are harassed and frowned upon, but still I support their rights.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Mr. Perdomo, I'm sorry that you feel as though an organisation supporting a community you dislike is infringing upon your rights, but it frankly is not. It's not saying You're straight, please leave, it's instead saying Please try not to discriminate. That's all.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
It’s called religious reasons
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Christian?
James B. - Desert District: 
No I think it’s because you’re homophobic.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I am not
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Or Catholic?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Your reasoning has changed three times in ten minutes.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">It’s called religious reasons
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Catholic
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This is getting off topic.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Thats differant, Homosexuality is illegal in Morocco, and the support of it is too.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Matthew 22:36-40
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
5/7 of the government members of Waterside Park are Christian, one Catholic, and they are all in support of LGBT+ rights.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
My mom’s side is catholic.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Sorry, not ten minutes, six.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
What does that have to do with me
James B. - Desert District: 
As if he’s read the Bible.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
True.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
 does raise a point, and we'll decide to Abstain with the pretence the group doesn't operate within the SR.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I have, mind you
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I’m just pointing it out.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Mr. Perdomo, what precisely do you have against an organisation that not only doesn't affect you, but you don't even have to join?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I feel like all people should care for each other regardless of sexuality, why all the fighting?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
And I still support this even though I have went to church and such.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Yeah.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I joined to steer my nation in the right direction, in my point of view
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Which is?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Monmark is present. I apologise for my absence thus far.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Good to see Monmark.
Well, maybe, haven’t heard much update on the PM.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
In the CA, all members help each other, you can't help yourself, why join the alliance?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Balancing Traditional and microwiki parts of the community
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
What do you mean by Traditional?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Well, maybe, haven’t heard much update on the PM.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
The people you have continuously condemned for no reason
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Sorry, maybe I should make myself clearer.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
When we admit members we not only have to think about how we would be helping that nation, but whether or not we would be protecting the integrity of this alliance.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">The people you have continuously condemned for no reason
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Berry Empire is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
What are your traditional values that led you to oppose the foundation of a community to support the LGBT+ community?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I am aware.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Catholic
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Alright.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Which precise values do you hold surrounding the LGBT+ community?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's a religion Andrew.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I’m catholic, full support.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I am Orthodox. I support.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Please, let's try not to post slurs here, in case people outside take offence to it.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The interesting thing about the SR, is that the majority of the people are most likely unfammiliar with what homosexuality is, as its not a common subject in rural Morocco or all of Morocco actually.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Don’t ask, don’t tell
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I’m catholic, full support.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I'm asking, please tell.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I'm sorry but what exactly are we debating?
James B. - Desert District: 
Jesus christ.
That’s disgusting.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I am guessing bad.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Oof..
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Montedizamble Act.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
From my point of view, we should support equality but I don't think an LGBTQ Assocuation is a good idea.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
No, the LGBTQ+ Association Act.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
LGBTQ Act.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Sorry, I have Alzheimer’s.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yes, you are incredibly old, Carson.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
No problem
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Says the Atheist
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Thank you.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Same.
James B. - Desert District: 
And?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I thought we were supposed to be formal and courteous.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Decorum, please!
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This bickering is beneath us is it not?
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Still don't think it's a good idea. I'd support something like Minorities act (minorities include LGBTQ+), but not LGBTQ+ act specifically.
James B. - Desert District: 
Why?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
This is getting off topic, we all agree Andrew has questionable views on LGBTQ, we should move on.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
What exactly defines minority?
James B. - Desert District: 
LGBTQ+ is easily the most persecuted minority here at the CA.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Do you all think we should move on?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Source
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
However the majority of the ones that do will most likely hold a negative opinion on the act of Homosexual intercourse due to their knowledge most likely coming from the Quranic verse of the People of Lod.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Race isn’t a giant issue to what I can see.
James B. - Desert District: 
Look in a mirror.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Hey
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
We are all off topic.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Decorum!
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
A racial, religious, political, national, or other group thought to be different from the larger group of which it is part.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I propose we move on.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
This petty squabbling is far beneath us.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
<span class="mention" title="A05#4062">@Andrew I - Pontunia</span> Please. Decorum.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Second!
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I have done nothing
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Ok?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
You can all continue arguing about this outside the session. We still have other things to talk about.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Okay buddy you legit just said “don’t ask don’t tell”. Homophobe.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
How?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What does that mean?
Dont ask dont tell
Warmedic - Monmark: 
These breaches of decorum and courtesy are not characteristic of the CA, and I propose we don't make it look like it by moving on!
James B. - Desert District: 
Why do we not let Andrew explain what he means by DADT?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Warmedic please.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Let's just move on..
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
He's on delay probably.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's a way to say Stop flouting your homosexuality but somehow it's not as bad
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
It's hard to move on when they are still talking about this
But I will try.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Sorry, Mr. Speaker.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is no longer present.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Don’t ask, Don’t tell us a neutral stance on lgbt that neither persecutes nor endorses lgbt rights
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
We have three applications to discuss on:

Republic of Surdam
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
2017, pretty old.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
If I remember correctly there was some criticism when they joined the GUM for their professionalism.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Looks very interesting.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Haven't heard a lot about them. But the fact they survived for 4 years is good.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
A lovely simplistic flag.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I think they were engaged in some Reddit sector conflicts but I shall check.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
They have rockets. I support their application.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I support it too then.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I will vote against. I remember them from the MA, the leader can be immature.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I support them.
Andrew I - Pontunia:

Redberry - Berry Empire: 
They could've changed.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

I will abstain
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
hey
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Abstain.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What does an abstaining vote do exactly?
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Nothing, exactly.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
It does not count.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I was saying that in response to James’s ad hominem attack
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Alright.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Many Ponderosan citizens have raided servers, your point is?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Anyone got anything more to say about Surdam? Or we move on?

Kingdom of Blazdonia</div>
The Kingdom of Blazdonia, commonly known as Blazdonia, is a micronation in Queensland Australia.
Kingdom of Blazdonia
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I support.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Democratic absolute Monarchy?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Fairly new by the look of it.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
Destroyed.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Blazdonia has an embassy in the Berry Empire.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Excuse me?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Agreed.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Can we move on from this, please.
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
Decorum please.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
So far, The Kingdom of Blazdonia has yet to lay claim to land and territory, opportunities will arise in future.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Are they the ones that lead the MMA?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is partially present
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
What does this mean? Do they have no territory?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
A no from me.

I oppose
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Kevin_Doan_of_Blazdonia">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Kevin_Doan_of_Blazdonia</a>
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
They don’t even claim anything.
They are not a nation.
Seems like a WIP.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Some micronations claim rocks, some claim shadow of its citizens..
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
To my own knowledge as far as it reaches, they do seem a bit immature.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I think I will abstain. Perhaps in future, after their nation has matured more, and claimed land, then perhaps they could be looked at more seriously.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I believe they leave the MMA
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
That last one..
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
That’s at-least something.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
They need a lot of development
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Agreed.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I dont understand what a Democratic Monarchy entails.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Maybe it's an elective absolute monarchy?
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Constitutional monarchy, basically.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Constitutional Monarchy I would assume?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
The wiki says The Kingdom of Blazdonia is governed as a Democratic absolute monarchy, currently under the kingship of King Kevin
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Uhh I think it’s different
I think the monarch is elected
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Isnt that a presidancy with extra steps?
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
It's pretty contradictive.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Or so I’ve seen in other “democratic monarchies”
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is present, again.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Thats just a president though.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov:

Their wiki page is lacking.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I will be voting against
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I would vote against
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
How is a Phoenix Empire different from a normal Empire?
Thorin Neal - Qaflana: 
I’m against.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's just the title.
Like the Free Nation of New Athens.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Their wiki page is very simple, but they claim to be established in 2016. I'm wondering if they have any proof.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan type of name I suppose.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
They may have been founded back then but I would expect a bit more development if they were active since.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
founded on May 6th, 2016 by Vincent Paul starting out as a small self-reliance militia. It grew from 3 people to fifteen in 3 months and they decided to fight for a kingdom that cared for them rather than money
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I would abstain due to lack of an eligible source of information.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
Sonderan is present.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Their leader is rather mature.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I abstain unless they can provide some kind of proof (a photo, age of their MW article, etc.)
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Vincent Paul?
Warmedic - Monmark: 
They have some distrust for MW if I recall correctly.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
The page was made on 10 September.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yes, they're affiliated with the Nexan Republic.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Yes, at least from what I remember.
Leon Montan - Ponderosa Hills: 
Youch.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Oh. Well.. I oppose for now.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
The nation itself has been around for longer.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I would support tabling this motion until perhaps Vincent can provide some more information on his nation in remarks.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Any further comments?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Nothing from me.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
I will be abstaining from this vote, and no.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I can’t support it, nothing further.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
If there's no further discussion, I'll allocate the next 5 minutes to national reports.
In Snagov, the Discord era has ended, and we are now entering the Golden era. With a local government, meetings, and promotion in the Snagov region coming soon.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra has marked the festival of Diwali and recognized the Republic of Melite these past few days.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Avalonia has started diplomatic talks with Lurdentania
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Soyuzist Republic is still figuring out how close the terrorist cells of Nadim al Maghrebi are to the territory. Some more information has been gathered on the Abandonned military base up north, for example it hosts a small runway of around 1 km in length, and was used for mainly surveilance and radio communication. The Soyuzist Elections saw the loss of the last seat of the Jucheist Party and saw the total domination of the electoral parliemant by the PEC. Furthermore, funds are being allocated to the December Diplomatic Project or First Soyuzist Campaign. The funds will go to Solar energy, literature, mobile phones, and more. Plans will be relayed in detail near the beginning of the campaign.
Sander I - Revalia: 
The state budget for the year 2022 has passed the Revalian Royal Parliament.
Warmedic - Monmark: 
Monmark has looked into increasing democratisation.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov:

Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
First discussion: Expulsion of Huai Siao
Thoughts?
Kasra - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Their activity has been very poor
Sander I - Revalia: 
Although I believe they have potential I am in support of the expulsion.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Soyuzist Republic is(finally on time) and present.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
They have barely participated since the last time they were almost suspended for inactivity
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Well then
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Have they given any explanation for their abscence?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Yeah. Unfortunately they are inactive.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I don't think so.
Ignis Audeladroit I - Terrerit&#233;: 
Then I support the motion
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Burdette is present.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Pontunia is Present
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Avalonia is Present
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I support the expulsion of Huai Siao.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I support the Explusion of Huai Siao, they have not done anything of note during my tenure here.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Shall we move on?
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present, and we support the expulsion of Huai Siao.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes it looks like we have a consensus
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I support it too
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Next we shall discuss on <strong>Ideas for another virtual summit</strong>
What do you think?
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I would love to meet for a virtual summit.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I support another virtual summit.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I would love another one.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would absolutely support another summit.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I would support another summit, if it will be organised properly.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I would like a virtual summit, communication may be a bit harder for some of us with our accents, but it's a great social gathering.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Yes. It also needs to be organized very well.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think we'd all love to do another one. The main question is what do we want to do? I figure we can have presentations again, followed by a session, then we need something to fill the time slot for the treaty that was signed, then do games again.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Any distinctive ideas though? Something special you have in mind?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
If anyone has any ideas for new things or changes, that would be great to hear
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Well tbh, why dont we start by introducing the micronations present with some trivia about their nation?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Would this be on Discord again?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes, in voice chat
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
A trivia would definitly be cool but that could be fit into games.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
CA trivia could be fun.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I agree.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Sounds good.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Any final thoughts?
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
We could focus on the climate, sovereignty of micronations and cooperation.
Or maybe do a physical micro event (even though majority of micronations won't be able to attend)
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
We could, if we want to do another treaty. That's the question.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
That would be a lovely addition
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
It would probably be hosted in England?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
You'd have to do it in a very small place, like England.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Aenopia is present.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Someday, maybe someday, we will all be able to meet, but who knows
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Not sure where majority of CA states is.. Micronear statistics say majority of users is from the US.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It wouldn't be appropriate right now due to the current pandemic.
Sander I - Revalia: 
I concur.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
True
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Correct.
Shall we move on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Yes.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Yes.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
US is way to big.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
This way more micros can attend.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Do you think someone from NY would go to LA? or vice-versa?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
See the thing is that means the micros that want to attend have to travel a long distance.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
That would probably end in everyone having to travel to Denver or something. Expensive.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
No but there are still many micronations.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Let's do a summit in Eastern Europe. Everything is quite cheap here.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I concur.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Decorum.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Ryanair prices are just coming down to be fair.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I concur.
A summit on the shore of the Snagov is a dream.
Anyway, let's move on.

Thoughts?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'm absolutely in support of this.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Given the situation, I support the motion.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Phillip - Pibocip is present. Sorry for the delay
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I see why we're doing this, but I'll be honest and say I'm not sure it accomplishes much. All this does is prevent him from becoming a delegate in the CA, but he's never attempted to, so I don't think this accomplishes anything other than publicly denouncing his actions. If that's our goal, then great, but multiple delegates called for action and this feels more symbolic than anything else.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur with the honourable delegates from Aenopia and Revalia.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I see why we're doing this, but I'll be honest and say I'm not sure it accomplishes much.

Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
What's he done?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Speaking of which, was Monmark not supposed to have been hosting an emergency session on his fate?
<div class="quote">What's he done?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
They've been doing that for almost a month now.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
It's unsurprising considering that he has a Joker profile picture.
<div class="quote">They've been doing that for almost a month now.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Who is Monmark?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
A member state.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It meets today.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Even if it's symbolic, we must show our attitude.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur, I just wanted to make that point so people knew exactly what the result of this would be.
Sander I - Revalia: 
Very well.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It has my support.
It doesn't read as revealing enough to be symbolic, and I definitely don't want the individual here even if they haven't tried before.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Should we move on?
Sander I - Revalia: 
Yes.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think that would be fine.

Opinions?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think it's good. It gives ministers more control over their deputies.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I concur.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This is something that arguably should have been included since the start of the Alliance in my opinion.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Question: This removes the Chair approving of deputy picks we debated this a while ago and the Minister who wrote this act argued that the Chair should approve of Deputy Minister picks.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support the act
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The Chair can still dismiss a deputy. This just gives the ministers the power to do so as well.
It also clarifies the point you made
Sander I - Revalia: 
I support the Act as well.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Sensible, I support it as well
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
We move on?
I suppose so.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov:

Thoughts?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support his nomination.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
So do I.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I think my support is implied
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I support the nomination.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I support it.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
All my support
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Does anyone have anything more to say?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Nothing more from me
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Unfortunately it seems like there's not a lot of people left. We shall still continue though.
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
Humberlea is present.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
<strong>Second discussion on the Montediszamble Act</strong>

Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
So what does this act do summarised?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This still has my support.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
CA member states shouldn't be signatories.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Yes I'll go for supporting it as well
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It blocks states who have signed the Montediszamble Convention from applying, and will expel current member states who sign it in the future.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Those who sign the Montediszamble Act after December 1st cannot apply for CA membership.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
There is no reason why any signatories of the Montedizamble Convention should be a member of the CA.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Setting a little bit of standard doesn't hurt
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
By allowing them in, we are simply turning a blind eye to the issues with the convention.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Yes, ignore my statement Mr. Martin explained it better than me.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The only issue is that it's shown to be difficult for signatories to remove their signature.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
And what was the montediszamble Act, i get the jist but why is it such a bad act?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">The only issue is that it's shown to be difficult for signatories to remove their signature.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It is a convention written to attempt to deflect criticism of Yaroslav Mar, following transphobic comments.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
More reason as to why it shouldn't be supported by the CA. Those who are currently signed aren't penalized, so this shouldn't be a problem.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I oppose, but my opinion is considered irrelevant around here
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It masks itself as just being pro-freedom of speech, but there are motives in the background there.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I'm sorry to hear that.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
As long as this remains the case, I support the act. I just want to avoid punishing a member who legitimately wants to remove their signature, but can't.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What do you mean?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">It is a convention written to attempt to deflect criticism of Yaroslav Mar, following transphobic comments.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's not that your opinion is considered irrelevant, but rather that you refuse to elaborate past single words.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Them removing their signature should be enough for us to note them removing it, as an organization it would be counter-productive to take Yaroslav's word over those who are trying to distance themselves from him.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I feel that the CA has repeatedly been hypocritical regarding montedezamble with ad hominem attacks on the convention
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
How so?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
How have we been hypocritical?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Irrelevant implies nobody listens to you, which would be wrong, unpopular is maybe a more fair phrasing
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
You consider the convention invalid because Yaroslav made it
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
And that's hypocritical how?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
That's not hypocracy.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I meant fallacious
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
In what way?
Don't worry Andrew. I've got a stick of Brighton Rock and a comfy chair. Take your time.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
How is that fallacious?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Ad Hominem fallacy
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I always end up sending my message 1-2 seconds after Larry does.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The Parliament needs more to work with than adjectives. We are more than willing to hear your rational.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It's not about his character, it's about his motives.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
This.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I concur.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
It’s an Appeal to motive fallacy
I have a hard way of placing words
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
That statement itself is a fallacy, known as the fallacy fallacy.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
So transphobia, homophobia or racism is a form of fallacy?
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
We don't have some random vendetta against him for no reason; Mar has made some outright horrible comments.
This treaty is merely defending these comments of his.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
The motive might have been impure, but the result was a good treaty
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It's not a good treaty.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
This.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It leaves a lot of room for very harmful speech and encouragements.
But this isn't a conversation on the merits of such.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
What should happen is minor alterations, but I’ll move on
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It's already notoriously difficult to even remove a signature, with that record altering the document itself seems near impossible.
With the reputation of it, and the contents, it is better for the CA to encourage members to remove their signatures and replace the convention with their own internal laws pertaining to the subject.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Well, I would be fine with mild discouraging, but an outright ban is horrible
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
What do you think about using cryptographic signatures?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I disagree.
We need to take a stand as an alliance.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It wouldn't fix the problems of the convention, but going forward it might be worth it to ensure that this same situation with difficultly removing sigantures is avoided.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Not on something the alliance does not even abide by.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I agree, it can't help anyone with treaties signed in the past, but it'd make signature removal much much easier.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The alliance is made up of nations.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
It doesn't really work for signatures in person...
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It's not a separate entity.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
It does.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
And as an entity, it has the right to vent what nations become members.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
But you still have to calculate the cryptographic hash using a computer.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
What if there is no digital copy?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I feel like this might be slightly off-topic.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I concur.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Then we can assume the treaty has not been signed.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Why would we assume a treaty hasn't been signed just because there is no digital copy?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Shall we move this conversation over to the members' pub?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I concur
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur. We should move on.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
If the Session Speaker desires so I will.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Alright.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Well, I would be fine with mild discouraging, but an outright ban is horrible
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
<strong>Act on establishing the Cupertino Alliance LGBTQ+ Association</strong>
<a href="https://lgbtq.cupertinoalliance.com/act/CUPERTINOLGBTQ.pdf">https://lgbtq.cupertinoalliance.com/act/CUPERTINOLGBTQ.pdf</a>
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Membership in the Cupertino Alliance is a privilege for nations, not a right - if we introduce a bill that's evidently in the best interests of everyone, then it's up to you to stay or leave.
However we shall leave this for a later date.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I oppose
The act
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I oppose
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I feel as though my support is implied.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This still has my support.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I oppose.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
What are the reasons of opposition?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I still support this act.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
If anbody wants to make an LGBT exclusive members pub it can be done, but it should absolutely not be a concern of the cupertino government.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Again, I dont understand the purpose of the act.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I feel like you haven't read the act.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
That's not what's happening.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I don't think it requires an association. A treaty would be more appropriate.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Correct
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It's not exclusive. Anyone can join it.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Then please don't state any opinions before you do.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
The CA already supports LGBT rights, why make a brand new organization that does what the CA already does
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Might be a good idea but I feel like my argument won't be changed
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">I don't think it requires an association. A treaty would be more appropriate.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This is very disheartening to hear from a member of ministerial staff.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Personally I don't think we need an association to promote LGBTQ+ communities and rights within the Cupertino Alliance and its member states. We should already be doing that.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I feel as if delegates do not truly understand the point of this Act.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
You would think.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I concur. Please
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
To make sure LGBT communities in member states aren't being suppressed.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The CA should be the safe haven, not a dependent agency.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
They are not, at least in Pontunia
Phillip - Pibocip: 
The Kingdom of Pibocip is rooted in the social contract theory, Catholic Social Teaching, and practiced using the principle of subsidiarity. In standing with all those who are marginalized or oppressed in their society, we desire to promote truth, justice, freedom, peace, and love to all people. Therefore, we will support the action of establishing the Cupertino Alliance LGBTQ+ Association. On a personal note, I teach Theology at a Catholic university, where we are asking ourselves similar questions to the Cupertino Alliance. The Theology of the Catholic Church and the ideologies governing Pibocian Society take seriously the philosophies of the Ancient Greek Philosophers, namely that of Aristotle. “In their analysis of human nature, the ancient philosophers recognized that friendship is absolutely essential for the good life, for true happiness. Friendships of various kinds are necessary for a full human life” (USCCB 2008). It appears necessary, therefore, for members of the LGBTQ+ community to be a part of the larger Cupertino Alliance community. If the intention of this LGBTQ+ Association is to help create an atmosphere of community through solidarity and mutual respect, then I, on behalf of The Kingdom of Pibocip, will support. Thank you.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Thank you, Phillip.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Wonderfully put.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I'm sorry for looking stupid in not reading the act but after reading the act I can attest that my argument(s) haven't been changed. I don't feel like this should be a concern of the cupertino government.
Logan Ross - Aenopia:

Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
It will seek to promote LGBTQ rights in the CA and its members states, so it will seek to spread the idea into the states themselves as well?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The LGBT community shouldn't be?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yes.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I see the benefit, but I think a better course of action would be to start programs and pass legislation in the CA to better meet this goal.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
the rights, not the idea I think
Phillip - Pibocip: 
The only concern I have is with article 2.3... could we elaborate what we mean by “promoting LGBTQ+ rights within member states?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The promotuon of the idea of their rights is what I mean, in my country that comes with legal issues.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Effectively, asking that member states have proper discrimination protection in place.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I will say that while Pontunia opposes the bill, we do not oppose the community at large
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
At the end of the day the Soyuzist Republic is within the Territories of the  Kingdom of Morocco, and therefor hsd to follow the laws of the cou try if not to fall on a list with the Mokhabarat.
Therefore I oppose
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I just think we should be fixing these issues in the CA instead of making a dependent agency to manage it.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
To put it very bluntly; a CA LGBT community isn't necessary. By that I don't want you to think that I don't support the existence or importance of the LGBT community but I feel it has not very much to do with the CA.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Mokhabarat has stated no group may promote LGBTQ rights within its borders, other then the government accepted Kif-Kif organisation
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">At the end of the day the Soyuzist Republic is within the Territories of the  Kingdom of Morocco, and therefor hsd to follow the laws of the cou try if not to fall on a list with the Mokhabarat.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The rights of people in member nations isn't a concern of the CA to you?
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
What will Abstaining do though?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Nothing
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Oh.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Thank you. I remember Pibocip had an issue with the LGBTQ+ friendliness survey. Not that we are homophobic but that our philosophy as a micronation doesn’t handle issues addressed by that survey.... if that makes sense
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
It’s going to pass anyway, I’m certain
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Abstaining does nothing really.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Then I remain with my stance, I geuss.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It effectively shows that you have a neutral response to it. No strong feelings one way or the other.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Look at it from a practical standpoint and not just a moral one, exactly how much does the CA have to say within the legislation of each nation?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That survey had its issues.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
As much as it wishes.
How much do you wish it to have?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
We honestly need a revised version.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
As much as the nations wish
Right?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
that's what the charter would say.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Well I personally don't but legally I have to go against the idea of such an organisation doing such inside of our micronation.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
And as nations of the CA, isn't that up to us?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Now you're getting into sovereignty debates. Member states have a right to do what they please, but we also have a right to expel them. That's about where it has to end.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">We honestly need a revised version.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
My personal opinion is that it's just not our business, nor is it then worth to create layers of buerocracy to pretend that it is.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I concur.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Pontunia is interested
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Not exactly.
I'm arguing against the idea that we can't do something.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I should add the over time, this association <strong>would</strong> become independent.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
A 2022 version could be upon us.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We make up the alliance we say exactly what it does, the argument that we can't for whatever reason is odd.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
All we can do is tell them to do something or they'll be expelled. We have no power outside of that.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That's power enough.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Then why have it attached in the first place.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Do something like what?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Because, according to the Charter, that's how it works.
Sorry, nothing I can do about that.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Every anti-LGBT country gets expelled then? Morally I think that is a good idea but practically it's a disaster idea.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I concur
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
We can't just look at the moral factors
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That's why this act would be a good idea. It would be better to promote change in those nations rather than just expel them.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Like I said, it's good to establish a safe haven for the LGBT community, but I stand by my opinion that we should work to make the CA the safe haven, not a dependent organization.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
And that is my only concern. There may be some micronations that (for whatever reason) may not be able to adopt legislation in their own micronation. Other than that, I support the ideals the LGBTQ+ organization
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This is very practical, promoting change in CA member's is a better route than just kicking them out. That's what this organization seeks to do, and thats why you see this organization instead of a mass expelling bill.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't believe nations should be penalized for literally not being able to implement such changes should they have the best intentions at mind.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
We can promote that change through a CA LGBT+ safe haven program.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Members of the LGBT+ shouldn't need a safe haven, it should be a given.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I agree
I said that already
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Then let an organization be created which would promote changes to ensure a safe haven isn't needed.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It already exists. It's called the Cupertino Alliance
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It clearly doesn't.
Otherwise this wouldn't be on the table.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Then improve it instead of making a new organization.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Agreed! How would that be determined though?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
We're just passing the responsibility by making this department.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Would this act give the organization any control of member nations domestic affairs?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Have you taken it up on your own?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
That's part of what the Montedizsamble Act seeks to achieve.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I suppose just by their macronational laws, it would definitely have to be a case by case thing a majority of the time sadly.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
But we need to be able to do lobbying, too. Free from the main administration.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Pontunia will never be a member of the proposed organization, but that does not mean we do not support that community.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
You should vote aye so that people who do want to be part of it can be.
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
<div class="quote">Pontunia will never be a member of the proposed organization
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I ask again.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
No.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
No.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Technically it would promote it, not enforce it.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
It simply seeks to put pressure on legislatures to promote LGBTQ+ rights where possible.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I don't see a reason why we can't do that ourselves as the CA.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It's an organized lobbying group.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This is the CA, it's just the CA organizing a specific place for it to happen.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I will not want this lobbing group.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Fair. I mean, to be fair, Although we support an organization, I don’t know if Pibocip will be adapting any new legislation, mainly because we dea with them according to our tradition.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Because in the future, we might get a chair who shuts it down. We might get a cabinet who shuts it down. Everything that can change, will quite possibly change.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
From what you said earlier, I doubt Pibocip will be a nation of focus for the organization.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Having this separately stops that from happening, by electing someone who actually believes in the cause.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
We should be pushing this to be happening in the entire CA, not just through this specific association.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
* deal with the ideas * sorry should have been clearer
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Are you, as Chair of the Board, going to?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I'd be more than happy to.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
And how are you going to ensure that future Chairs will, too?
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Thank you!
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Great, you should join the organization when it gets made.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The Act on Establishment of the Cupertino Alliance LGBTQ+ Association has the risk to be repealed just the same as any other legislation in the future.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It's a safer bet than you remaining as Chair forever.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Pontunia’s delegates and citizens will neither be encouraged nor encouraged to join this group. Free choice.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The association isn't up for vote every 6 months, and if it shows merit it can remain.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
If you support free choice you should support the act so that everyone can have the free choice of joining or not.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I will abstain
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Alright.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
So it's for individuals?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Please read it.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I did
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Then why are you asking?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not after a few months. It will more than likely become an independent agency before your tenure ends.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
We can write CA legislation to serve the same goals as the association. We can start the same programs. We could even appoint the equivalent of a safeguarding officer for the LGBT community that will oversee these projects. I support everything this association will do, I just think from an organizational standpoint it should be set up differently. It should be the CA's responsibility to uphold these values, not the association.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
So defensive
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The organization would be there to ensure the CA upholds the values, not to enforce the values itself.
It's intended to act as a check.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
There are no checks in this act though.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The organization as a whole is the check.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It just seeks to protect, promote and support. There's nothing in this act that holds the CA responsible for anything.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
The organization is there to hold the CA responsible.
It's an organized group to ensure that those things are being maintained in the CA.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It can only lobby for change.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That's all any of us can do.
This gives members and supporters of the community a clear way to organize and go about it.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Sorry to interrupt, can we move on? This session has become very lengthy and I'm afraid I'll only be available for 30 more minutes.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It technically doesn't do that either. It just designates a spokesperson. It doesn't specify anything of how this will actually be done. Ideally the association will write those guidelines in the future, but at that point it might as well just be CA legislation.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes we should probably move this conversation to a formal channel.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I can continue if you don't have the time but I hope we can go on for as long as we need.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I've never seen someone be so against something they support.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Thank you for that!
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We can move on, i'd be okay with it and continuing it in a formal channel elsewhere.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Stormhold is present.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Delegates argue against proposals for bureaucracy then want to make an entirely new sub-org that isn't clearly routed.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
We have 5 applications we will take a look at:
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes lets move on

Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I support their entry.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Looks wonderful, I support them
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
This is the same one led by Mr. Hamilton, yes?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support their re-entry.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Yes.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Aren’t they in a confederation
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
If so, I'm in full support.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
It broke up from Swannia.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Nice
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I hardly see it as a question, if they're now independent again.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
(I think)
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I'd support their reentry as well.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I support
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
If they’re fully independent, I’ll support
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Great.

Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I support their entry
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Right of the bat, though I will read more, I believe they are exclusively dependent on a discord community, in which case I will oppose their entry.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I support their entry.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Seems like a lovely bunch, I support.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support their re-entry.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I wouldn't necessarily adopt this as a criterion of membership.
Stormhold uses Discord as its primary method of communicating with its most important citizens, as all of us have thousands of miles of distance between us.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
These are factors I consider personally.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Our operations are mostly virtual these days, as that's where our skills and communications tend to also intersect.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
They have physical claims it seems.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov:

Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Self reliance Militia?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Kingdom_of_Blazdonia">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Kingdom_of_Blazdonia</a>
Kingdom of Blazdonia</div>
The Kingdom of Blazdonia, commonly known as Blazdonia, is a micronation in Queensland Australia.
<a href="https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Republic_of_Surdam">https://micronations.wiki/wiki/Republic_of_Surdam</a>
Republic of Surdam</div>
The Republic of Surdam, or just Surdam for short, is a micronation founded on July 17th, 2017 by its current heads of state, President Surdam and President Caldwell. Surdam has a total of 26 citizens and the national currency is the Surdamian mark.</div>
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I support Blazdonia.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Personally, from all these 3, I think Surdam has the most potential
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
The latter is the only one I've heard of. I would support Surdam's entry.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I support Surdam.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
I support Surdam.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
I hear mixed things about Blazdonia, but my knowledge of them is extremely limited.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I support only blazedonia
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Therefore, nothing I say will be of use.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Is there an existing issue with Surdam we need to know about?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
They have had a history of immaturity with regards to their previous membership with the MA
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Dating back to which dates?
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
August, if I remember
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
As far as I remember (again, this being limited), the MA isn't the most reputable group to call one's self a part of.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
They were a decent organization, but have fallen a bit into inactivity
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
As for Blazedonia, do you have remarks on them?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I think that's all for tonight, I'll allow the following five minutes for national reports.
Mephistopheles - Stormhold: 
Stormhold has not done much the past several months. We have generally closed recruitment due to lack of internal activity, to keep from tensions arising from a long-term slow pace dragging potential new recruits around, as our membership deals with their own academic and real-world matters.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens has recently reached 60 citizens and has registered 2 businesses. We also had our 2nd in-person diplomatic meeting, this time with the founder of Theodia.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is currently preparing for an exodus of graduating senior students through a greater emphasis on local government with fresh faces. This shift includes a citizenship drive of students who won't be graduating, of which five new citizens have already joined.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Session is adjourned. Thanks to everyone for participating.

Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
Ponderosa Hills is present.
Logan Medlin - Qaflana: 
Well sixy kicked me from that position.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
We'll get started
Anthony I - Saspearian: 
Saspearian is present
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The first point is to discuss Huai Siao's expulsion due to inactivity.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
The delegation of Avalonia is present
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Given their lack of recent attendance, I support the motion.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support their expulsion. Huai Siao have not made any meaningful contribution in the session hall since August.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I would also be in support.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I am in support of Huai Siao's expulsion.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
I concur
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe they were put to vote for this before August, although the people in the Dhrub campaign were politely asked to vote against their expulsion, as Huai Siao had promised a vote for Roy.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
Have they come forward with a reason for their inactivity?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Not that I'm aware of.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It was also around that time that their main delegate pledged to improve their activity, but never really did so.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
That's interesting.
Aidan McGrath - Wendatia: 
wenbatia is preset
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
If there are no more comments, we'll move on
The next topic is discussion of ideas for the next virtual summit
I think we'd all love to do another one. The main question is what do we want to do? I figure we can have presentations again, followed by a session, then we need something to fill the time slot for the treaty that was signed, then do games again.
We could do another treaty, or something else to fill the gap.
Last session someone brought the idea of a CA trivia game during the game portion.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Maybe we could do it around the 150th session? That doesn't give very long though, only about a few weeks to plan.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Yeah
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
That could do, I assume.
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
I concur.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
Will there be a theme?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I like this idea quite a bit.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I think there should be discussion on issues like pollution or climate change, some agreement every nation should work towards
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Dhrub and I planned the entire Culture Fest in under an hour. We can definitely do it in that time frame if we don't delay.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Absolutely.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Great idea
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
The Berry Empire is present.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
It doesn’t have to be anything huge, maybe a pledge to reduce electricity consumption or create a recycling initiative
It doesn’t have to be environmental either
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
There was a convention regarding climate change in 2020; its name was Sough2020.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe there was a joint CA-GUM litter pickup a few months ago, we could try something like that again.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I concur.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Well, it could be any topic, restoration or a joint project, environment is just an idea, I know a lot of nations are passionate about it
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
We could also encourage micronations to plant plants. The plants will create oxygen and can be exported/eaten.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Speaking of which, Mr. Speaker, may I bring something up towards the end of the session?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That could allow for the revival of the greencities program
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Regarding exactly that.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Certainly
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Oh, great.
Let's continue on
Next we have a motion to proscribe James Thompson, Prime Minister of Monmark under the Individuals Veto Act, 2021. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJxsdomQQxfXBnHuLo0eiekfbm3uKCQiC4YmH6EW0fg/">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1VJxsdomQQxfXBnHuLo0eiekfbm3uKCQiC4YmH6EW0fg/</a>

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support this proscription.
Rory - Lurdentania: 
I support.
Jayden Lycon - Qaflana: 
Support
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I concur.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
His actions remain completely undefendable.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I would be in support
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I support it as well, but I'll be honest and say I'm not sure it accomplishes much. All this does is prevent him from becoming a delegate in the CA, but he's never attempted to, so I don't think this accomplishes anything other than publicly denouncing his actions. If that's our goal, then great.
Johann K&#252;mmel - Ponderosa Hills: 
I concur with Tyler.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
I always feel that motions banning particular individuals, like this one, need to be made with caution. Statements against a particular political stance, or in support of a particular ideological stance are better.
Is there a code of conduct in this alliance? Can we not just automatically ban individuals who fail to abide by that code of conduct?
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Well, we have the charter and the mission
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
So why do we need a separate motion to preemptively ban someone?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I believe the intent of this is to make a public statement as an alliance, denouncing his actions
Rory - Lurdentania: 
The Delegate from Sonderan has an Excellent Point.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
It’s not just denouncing it, I personally don’t feel comfortable having a person with his record of treatment here.
I’m sure a few others wouldn’t either.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
Wouldn’t it be more powerful to release a statement supporting the community targeted by James Thompson and reiterating that nations and individuals who are intolerant of said community will not be admitted or welcome in the Alliance? Something general that cuts to the core of the issue and sets a concrete precedent?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I have to agree.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That would be fine to happen, but James also shouldn’t be accepted here.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
For example, I always thought it was poor form for the GUM to name a particular individual in their statement against sock puppeting. For one, it dates the statement, for the other it seemed distinctly unprofessional.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I doubt he'd pass verification. I certainly wouldn't verify him.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Let’s just ensure it then, yeah?
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
West Sayville is present.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Whether this passes or not, I believe we should make the statement that Cedar recommended.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
James Thompson doesn’t deserve the individual attention of the CA. His behaviour should be addressed, the individual should be ignored.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Might I inquire as to where we are up to?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The motion to proscribe James Thompson, Prime Minister of Monmark under the Individuals Veto Act, 2021
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This is addressing his behavior by ensuring he isn’t allowed here.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Why not both?
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
Because it shows that he is worthy of our attention.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I fully support this motion .
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I’m not arguing against anything else happening. I just don’t see why those things happening justify throwing this away.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Well it appears that delegates want to ensure he's never allowed in, so it does appear worthy.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Preferably we wouldn’t have to ban them individually but we are working with what we have currently.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
I just feel like James Thompson is engaging in attention seeking behaviour and this sort of statement gives him publicity and what he wants.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
This isn’t a public statement and it was literally just him doing something out of hate.
It’s only becoming a public thing because we are arguing over it.
The simple fact is this act bans a slur using transphobe from a member nation from joining the CA, and that’s all it should be.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
I wasn’t aware that the session hall was public. I’m merely an observer at this point: if you have an existing method of doing things and this sits comfortably in that method, then I’ll refrain from further comment.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Alright lets move on to the Ministerial Amendment Act (by Daniel Hamilton) <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uug6k3j5tVH6yJbpCQPcV8_h0dUSOzwy0qvJmKX6WZQ/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1uug6k3j5tVH6yJbpCQPcV8_h0dUSOzwy0qvJmKX6WZQ/edit?usp=sharing</a>

I support this act.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I also support the act.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I would be in support of this act.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It clarifies who appoints deputies and gives ministers the power to remove their deputy.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Agreed
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Any further comments?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Nothing from me.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Good act. Nothing else here.

Any thoughts?
James Murray - Avalonia: 
This seems to be a contentious act
But I would be in support
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support the act.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
In my experience, the contention is from those who don't fully understand why the Montediszamble Convention is bad.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
I wholeheartedly support this act.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I support it as well.
Andrew I - Pontunia:

Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
They are.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
I would support their application.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I fully agree. Their past experience in the alliance makes them a good candidate.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
They left the Swannian Union and are now independent again.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
I support them
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is no longer present.

James Murray - Avalonia: 
If I'm not mistaken, they have a population of 1?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Their wiki claims 26
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
I thought a population of one and have been involved in ‘wars’ this year.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I recall it being 1 just a week or so ago
I could be mistaken
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Do you remember where you heard that?
James Murray - Avalonia: 
It was written on the wiki page
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Strange
I don't see anything at first glance of their wiki's edit history

Micronational Community of Australia
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Thank you
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It would be nice to have another member from that region
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I have no comment
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That's all for this evening. I'll leave the last 7 minutes of the hour for member reports.
New Athens has recently reached 60 citizens and has registered 2 businesses. We also had our 2nd in-person diplomatic meeting, this time with the founder of Theodia.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Avalonia's Ministry of Foreign Affairs founded the Avalon Institute two days ago, the first Avalonian state-affiliated research and news organization. Info can be found at avalonia.live.
Cedar - Triumvirate of Sonderan: 
Sonderan’s Chicken Festival has concluded with Memorial Hat Day and the census has closed. Our Christmas Festival begins on November 26th and citizens around the Nation are preparing to put up their trees on that date.

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I am in support of their admission.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I support their entry
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Has Orientia been revitalised?
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Did they come back?

It seems so. They seem familiar.

I don't know what to say about this though
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I believe I have heard of them
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
The eagle is awkwardly familar
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Symbols are interesting
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Oh jesus
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Maybe not in such a positive way
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
Very suspicious.
Thomas Marios - Ovrestlia: 
Yep, unfortunately familiar
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I wonder where else I've seen that eagle...
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The double headed eagle, symbol of imperialism; and the hammer and sickle, don't seem like the greatest combinations.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
It might just be an aesthetic choice however.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Not only does it recall the not so distant past of Germany but the more distant past as well.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
This is a nazbol symbol
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
The double headed eagle isn't very nazi now, is it.
It's the only thing that makes it distinguishable enough not to be deemed nazi symbolism.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
Orientia has been around for quite a while; I think it's common knowledge they aren't nazis.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Yeah. Just wanted to see your opinions.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
There is a thin line, but symbolically speaking, it barely just doesn't cross it.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Their Minister of Media is a dog, I don't know if I should support them or not
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
One state flag is just a picture of a Banana
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Their capital city is called Hui. For russian speakers, that's funny.
Can anyone tell me about their past in the CA? How were they?
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
Pretty good I think. However maybe I'll abstain from their re-admission.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe that's just the image they use to protect anonymity.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Their delegate was well esteemed to my knowledge. Pun Watta was the first minister of Asia/Oceania
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Don't search up Pocatello's old flag
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
It's certainly possible.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I don’t know much about their history, I will be sure to do more research into their governance
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
I remember one applicant, Tinland, was just Finland with a tin can at the crosspoint.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
I will abstain.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
There are micronations with joke names and flags, but with decent governments. And there are micronations with very good flags and names, but with terrible or non-existent government.
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
They're based out of thailand
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Some may even put Lundenwic is this bracket.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I saw that.
Does anyone else have more to say?
Jonas Rhymer - Wendatia: 
I remember orientia was around before, however they had to take hiatus due to several reasons
im talking late 2020
They were even in the GUM
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I remember seeing their flag in the GUM emoji list.
That's what seemed familiar
Well, I will allow the following 5 minutes for posting national reports.
The de facto Snagovian parliament discussed today about the official future ideology, and it was decided that it will be called Snagovism. Declaration to be announced later.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I will be leaving Monday on a trip to Avalonia’s Capital City. I will be staying for a week in the Presidential estate. On the agenda, we will be repairing and refurbishing our flag pole, having a flag raising ceremony, and inducting new citizens physically.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Soyuzist Republic YPM service is still researching more information on the Terror group known as Nadim al Maghrebi. The Soyuzist National Orchestra has worked on composing a new piece which will be shared for an early sneak peak in the near future. So far the first diplomatic campaign of the Soyuzist Republic through the mountainous area of Gurugu is going towards plan, starting in late december  and ending in Januari. The goal is to acquire more village within the coallition and establishing a stronger presence on the mountain.
Christopher Miller - Vishwamitra: 
-Due to withdrawal of the ambassador to Finland, the Rashtradhyaksh has appointed the Estonian ambassador to serve as ambassador-at-large.

A very interesting emblem they have for their congress.
I will still support them though.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes I probably wouldn't have chosen those symbols
Daniel Quintero - Floriland: 
Yes, the resemblance to the original design is a little too close.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I have not heard much about them, I will be sure to do some additional research

Sorry for the delay.
I would be in support of Sonderan's promotion to full member.

Other than that, they have been very professional.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra:

I will likely vote to support their promotion.

I shall consider this as no. Moving on, the next is the third reading of Orientia.

The remarks of Orientia.
The floor is open.
I fully support their acceptance into the organization.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I support their acceptance as well.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I'll be abstaining.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I have not heard much about them, but seeing as they used to be a member of the CA, I'm sure their acceptance is warranted.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you. Does anyone else wish to contribute to it?
Jayden I - Novus Hierosolymis: 
I think this is a no-brainer. I support their return to the Alliance.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Perfect. Thank you.
With this, we have reached to the end of the session.
The Vishwamitran general election came to an end today with the results to the election to 4 constituencies being declared. The dominant National People's Congress which had won 15 seats unopposed won 2 of the contested seats, while two were won by the newly formed Green Socialist Party. Former PM Farhaz Hazarika is all set to begin his second term in office.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I will be leaving Monday on a trip to Avalonia’s Capital City. I will be staying for a week in the Presidential estate. On the agenda, we will be repairing and refurbishing our flag pole, having a flag raising ceremony, and inducting new citizens physically.
Andrew I - Pontunia: 
Pontunia will be having its first Exposition, showing off it to the people
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The session is adjourned.

Northwood-Oregon is present.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park is present.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is present
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Thank you all for attending. The first item on the agenda is about a CA minecraft server. I know that the GUM has one and it is very popular. Does anyone have any thoughts on this?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I definitely think that that is something we should do. Wasn’t there some free way to do it I heard mentioned using a Google cloud thing?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
For additional context, the plan would be to host a java server on the New Athens server and include a plugin that allows bedrock players to join it as well.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I support the creation of a CA minecraft server, but I'm concerned that there might not be enough people here to start a session?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Is there a certain number? I thought as long as we could have discussion we could have one.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I understand your concern, however we have had sessions in the past with this many in attendance
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Well this agenda only includes discussions, so Roberts Rules allows us to continue
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Ok, if there is nothing to add about the CA minecraft server, I'll move on.
Next we have the agenda of the digital summit: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QnNOOI3m8i_Zl27GgNhzxuRiWCNmXsqi/edit?usp=sharing&ouid=108218187524410698551&rtpof=true&sd=true">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QnNOOI3m8i_Zl27GgNhzxuRiWCNmXsqi/edit?usp=sharing&amp;ouid=108218187524410698551&amp;rtpof=true&amp;sd=true</a>

The event will occur on 4 December 2021 at 19:00 UT...</div>
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Have we have any ideas for guest talks, yet?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It's one week from today. As of right now, we won't be doing a treaty. If you'd like to give a presentation, send me a message.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I could always do a presentation on Lundenwic. I'm guessing presentations would need to be centred on micronationalism?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Yes
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Perfect!
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I was thinking about inviting Jonathan of Austenasia
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
OK
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I would like to do a presentation but I wouldn’t be sure who else to invite.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
It's Jon, but that is not a bad call. Are we actively looking for people outside of the organisation?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
For the guests I’d think we want to get that diversify.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes ideally we'd get a few guest speakers
But I just don't know who
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Are we going to limit it to people we invite?
As opposed to an open call.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I concur
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Perhaps we could ask members for suggestions and see if those suggested are willing to participate? I'd quite like to ask Jack Dean. I've seen him present before.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think that would be good. Is there a standing committee open on the summit?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
                     <span class="preserve-whitespace">Yes, <span class="mention">#summit-and-events-standing-committee</span>
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Alright, we could start gathering suggestions there among other things we need.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Perfect. I suggest we move on and further discussion be moved there.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That sounds good with me.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Next on the agenda is the start of a new Noted! project. As I understand the aim is to mail a letter to as many members as possbile.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I definitely would like to see that project either continue or start again.
Did we have a goal of if to continue or just start from the beginning?
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
The previous incarnation was successful, however, I am very wary of minors sharing there addresses with others, which was why I was not involved in the last round.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I'd participate if we did another round
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I'd start a new one
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I think the way they minimized that in the past was that only the person holding the letter and was sending it was told the address as opposed to the whole group.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes that's true
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
We could though, hypothetically, advise minors to have the letter sent to an older relative’s address or PO Box if they have access to that? In order to give a layer of separation.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Yes, but that still doesn't quite eliminate the risks involved. It makes me uneasy, but if the Chair and Supreme Justice are fine with it, I'm happy.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
This could be a compromise.
I don't meant to put a spanner in the works of these activities, just want to make sure that we are not putting people at risk needlessly.
It's a great idea and I do believe there are ways of getting around this. I think we need a bit more discussion around it though.
For now, I'll move on.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I concur.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
for drafting it and <span class="mention" title="Darkstar1592#1047">@Tyler Mullins - New Athens</span> for reviewing it.

Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
and <span class="mention" title="Charles#3736">@Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia</span> reviewed it as well.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I don't think we can reasonably read and discuss it all in this session, so I invite members to read in their own time, maybe make some notes and and add them to the Charter-Standing-Committee channel.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
I apologise to the two I missed. I was unaware of your contributions, so thank you too.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The soyuzist republic is present for a short duration
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I believe that Article 19 should include a lower age limit of 13.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Could I ask that this is taken to the appropriate channel than being discussed in this session?
The last item on the agenda is Any Other Business. So does anyone present have anything to add?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I have none, just member reports now I suppose
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don’t have anything either.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Indeed. Brilliant! I'll leave the floor open for members to present reports. I'll give you 5 minutes to do so.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
New Athens is now capable of trade with other nations. Barbecue rub and sauces are our main exports at the moment. My father competed in professional-level barbecue competitions for 6 years and was ranked top 10 in the USA in chicken, ribs, pork and brisket. The sauce and rub we trade is the recipe he used in competitions. I posted a photo on our Twitter. We'd love to engage in trade with others.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Northwood-Oregon is currently working on a revised economic system after finishing designs of its new currency. The new system is planning to be much more centralized and include a plan for printing the new currency.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
The Imperial Grand Duchy of Lundenwic will be transforming the position of Prime Minister to hold greater powers in office with limited interference from the Imperial Grand Duke. This is not a coup. The title will be renamed to Dryhten of Lundenwic and will still share the executive powers of Lundenwic with the Imperial Grand Duke.
And with that I will adjourn the session. Thank you for those that attended and I apologise that the session was a little late to start.
Hicham Soyuz - Soyuzist Republic: 
The Soyuzist Republic diplomatic first campaign of December has been delayed until July, but time hasn't gone to waste as the Republic has gained 500 euros to go to the project as delayment payment. The Soyuzist Republic is also preparing to release a national march as an hommage to the diplomatic missions done so far. Nadim al Magrebi, terror organisation of northern Morocco funded by AQ, has still yet to be located by the YPM, but knowledge on hashish businesses are currently being gathered.
Lord Mike Lewis - Lundenwic: 
Glad to have your national report, but the session did adjourn about 5 minutes before it. Please be mindful not to use the session hall once the session has been adjourned.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
(national report)
Oh adjourned, should I delete it?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Thank you but the session is adjourned

Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The first point on the agenda is gauging interest in a CA members-only (and friends of members) minecraft server. For additional context, the plan would be to host a java server on the New Athens server and include a plugin that allows bedrock players to join it as well.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Snagov is present
Regarding the Minecraft server, I wish that it will also be available to non-premium players?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Aside from what was said last session, will we just have the server open to just CA delegates?
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
The server should require the user name to be white listed. Thus granting access only upon request.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It won't be advertised to non-delegates, but you're welcome to invite your friends.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
Phillip - Pibocip is present
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Will it be survival or creative?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Survival primarily
Charles Burgardt - Pinelandia: 
Pinelandia is present.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
So basically a system where people who are sponsored to join by a delegate can join?
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Burdette is present
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I had the idea of member states claiming territory on the map (like in the GUM server)
We can build the server with Aternos, thus allowing everyone regardless if they bought the game or not.
It allows for plugins, mods, and easy management.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I'll take a look
We'll move on
We have the discussion regarding the upcoming digital summit agenda: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QnNOOI3m8i_Zl27GgNhzxuRiWCNmXsqi/">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QnNOOI3m8i_Zl27GgNhzxuRiWCNmXsqi/</a>

It's one week from today. As of right now, we won't be doing a treaty. If you'd like to give a presentation, send me a message.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Who is making the Kahoot Trivia?
I guess we should just mostly be checking to make sure everything is ready at this point.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I can make it, since I'll be hosting the event.
It'll probably be around 20ish questions
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
It would be nice to include facts about every member state
Phillip - Pibocip: 
I like that idea.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
There might be a few of those, though it'll primarily be on CA history, projects and events.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
That's fine. It will not be the only time we would be playing.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Also, having questions about member nations gives that nation's delegates a bit of an unfair advantage, but I'll try to find a balance.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That's true, how many speakers do we have by chance?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Since the agenda is being finalized today in sessions, applications for speakers hadn't opened yet. Though if you'd like to give a 10-15 minute presentation, send me a message and I'll add your presentation to the summit agenda.
Any final comments before we move on?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I don't have anything else.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Next on the agenda is the start of a new Noted! project. It's a project where a letter is mailed from one participant to the next, each adding something to the letter, then finally returning it to the start.
Is there interest in starting another round of it?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
There’s still support from me as long as we provide advice and disclaimers around the whole address situation.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I would be interested as long as I don't have to do international shipping.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Like making sure those who participate know what they are doing, and providing advice to minimize risk of sharing an address.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Yeah, that's important.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Oh yes that also brings up making sure people know the cost of mailing.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Maybe, we can list our local post office instead of our homes?
And then pick it up?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That would be wise
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
That sounds like a pretty safe way to do it.
James B. - Desert District: 
Desert District is present
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Also I have another idea, each person puts a small (very small) souvenir in the package to send, and the person receiving takes it and then puts another for the next person and so on
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
I don't use my local post office.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
hope that made sense
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
well, are you comfortable giving your address?
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
I proposed also maybe using a relatives house as an alternative so that you don’t give out your personal address.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Yes.
Carson S. - Northwood-Oregon: 
Well then that settles it too
James B. - Desert District: 
Aternos is way too slow if you have more than 3 people and secondly we should not encourage any illegal activity such as piracy.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Damn.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Fair point.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Having a good time shouldn't cost money
But whatever
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Let's move on to the final point on the agenda
James B. - Desert District: 
Well the creators made a game and they deserve payment for it.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
23 Euros, that's like 3 weeks food supply. I'll not play then...
James B. - Desert District: 
Well ok, but as an alliance helping people commit crimes is not a good idea.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
for taking extensive time to draft it. <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIFl9xKCr4kzhKT4-5E9CGLvOUls7DQM_UAkFDrt70w/edit?usp=sharing">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UIFl9xKCr4kzhKT4-5E9CGLvOUls7DQM_UAkFDrt70w/edit?usp=sharing</a>

Since discussion on it won't be happening in this channel, this concludes the agenda for today's session. Thank you all for attending. The next 9 minutes are reserved for member reports.

Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Snagov is planning to establish a space agency. Opinions are split in the parliament.
James B. - Desert District: 
Not much has happened.
James B. - Desert District: 
Is there a smoked brisket rub recipe?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes. Smoked brisket, pork, chicken and ribs.
James B. - Desert District: 
Where can I get it?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I'd mail it to you

For additional context, the plan would be to host a java server on the New Athens server and include a plugin that allows bedrock players to join it as well. What do you all think of this?
James B. - Desert District: 
That sounds like a great idea.
And I repeat that we should not encourage piracy among members in obtaining the game.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
If there's support, I would plan to launch it during the games portion of the digital summit next week.
Phillip - Pibocip: 
I think it would be a fun continuing community builder
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
I would absolutely be in support of a CA minecraft server - it's something that I've proposed and supported in the past.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
The only snag is that the new minecraft update comes out this week, so we may have to choose between playing the new version or including the requested server plugins.
Though it might not be impossible for us to start a 1.17 world with the plugins, then update it to the new 1.18 version once they're updated. But it's up for discussion.
Any final comments before we move on?
Logan Ross - Aenopia: 
Nothing from me.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Then we'll move along to the discussion regarding the upcoming digital summit agenda: <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QnNOOI3m8i_Zl27GgNhzxuRiWCNmXsqi/">https://docs.google.com/document/d/1QnNOOI3m8i_Zl27GgNhzxuRiWCNmXsqi/</a>

Does anyone have any comments or thoughts on the plan for the summit?
I'll take that as a no.
Next on the agenda is the start of a second run of the Noted! project. It's a project where a letter is mailed from one participant to the next, each adding something to the letter such as a drawing, a stamp, or a message etc, then eventually returning it to the start. Is there interest in starting another round of it? For security and safety reasons, it was recommended in the last session that we encourage participants to list their local post office instead of their homes.
Does anyone have any comments on reviving the project?

Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Yes, POSTE RETANTE is a great idea, is there a list of micronations that will participate?
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I would be very happy to partake in a Noted! project.
Maybe one of us could start it for the 150th session summit?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That's a neat idea
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
There's no list at the moment. A form will be provided that delegates can fill out to state their intention to participate.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I think we should prepare the route for the letter/s so it won't travel from America to Europe to America to Europe.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Should I open a form? I'll be happy to plan it, as I think it might be under my ministry.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Not only because it'd slow it down, but the letter can also get lost.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Yes the route is set once applications are closed.

Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
I wholeheartedly support the introduction of a new Charter.
Having read through it, it all looks good so far.
Isaiah Burdette - Burdette: 
Looks pretty good to me.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
That's it for this weekend's sessions. I'll post the gazettes shortly. The next 10 minutes are reserved for member reports.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Waterside Park faced stormy conditions today, however no damage has been reported as of yet.
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
I feel like a broken record because I've reported on this twice already today, but it's the latest news. New Athens is now capable of trade with other nations. Barbecue rub and sauces are our main exports at the moment. My father competed in professional-level barbecue competitions for 6 years and was ranked top 10 in the USA in chicken, ribs, pork and brisket. The sauce and rub we trade is the recipe he used in competitions. I posted a photo on our Twitter. We'd love to engage in trade with others.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
I support this.
James B. - Desert District: 
How much does the rub cost?
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
Nothing, it's a trade of goods. You'd send us something and we'd send the rub.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Might be an idea for Noted!
James B. - Desert District: 
I don’t know what to send…
Nicholas Lokin – Humberlea: 
If you somehow manage to get to Toronto, Humberlea would be happy to trade.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
Apologies for being late. Avalonia is present
Tyler Mullins - New Athens: 
It could be as simple as a sticker or mini flag, just something unique to your nation. It's more about diplomacy than what's being traded.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
That sounds like a really cool idea! I’d be open to trading
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Desert Distinct constitution, signed original.
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
We could also make a list of participants that'd like to obtain flags of other micronations (or something else) so it can be delivered to them.
James Murray - Avalonia: 
I’m looking into something like that
Redberry - Berry Empire: 
Such flags could be used to establish micro-embassies.

First reading: Act Against Fraudulent Identities, Sockpuppeting, etc. (By Dhrubajyoti Roy)
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As the bill is drafted by me, I would be in full support for it. However, I would appreciate for members to highly discuss it.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I support this act.
Pun Watta - Orientia: 
Although Orientia is only an observer, we are in full support of this bill, given the recent allegations directed towards delegates of the CA.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Mr Speaker, may I?
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Yes, can you clarify?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Have the floor, please.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Sure, you have the floor
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Could the author elaborate on what “provisions are being considered?”
Mr Roy?
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
I have the same doubt
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Pardon me, but I did not understand your query well?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
It seems more of a definition clause than actual provisions of the act.
There is nothing being ordered in this section.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The punishment to be awarded to any delegate who has been found to sockpuppet has been listed in the bill.
I believe that is what you wanted to know?
An initial suspension which will be further dealt by the Chair and the Superior Judge.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
No sir, I am saying there are no provisions to be considered.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I am not sure but I am being unable to understand your query. Maybe you could elaborate with some example?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I think the bill should be reworded to “<s>Under the Act</s> The following definitions will serve as a guideline for the superior court to make decisions based on delegate actions;“
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I have made amendment to the draft bill changing the word provisions with definitions
I believe that is appropriate?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Much better actually
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Act isn’t supposed to be capitalized either
Nor is clause, nor is article
It’s a well authored act, just a few mistakes
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Thank you and suggested amendments have been made.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
No problem!
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
I feel that if the bill is unanimously adopted, we could avoid situations like the one with Bicarbonate of Soda.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
If anyone has anything has else to say, please speak now, otherwise I will move to the next topic of the agenda
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
In hindsight, the situation was a little humorous but in the long run it isn’t ethical
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
But the situation did go out of humour and had to be taken seriously to some extent. It is quite unfortunate that several notable community members to have been associated with it
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
This situation was quite innocent and made as a joke but I believe this act will encourage the stop of possible malicious attempts in the future

Remarks - Republic of Caelesta</div>
Membership Application Remarks  29 November 2021  Application Information  Name of Applicant: Republic of Caelesta Applicant delegate(s): Connie Applied on: 27 November 2021  Basic Information  Date of Foundation: 28 February 2021 Location: Romania Region: Europe Citizen...</div>
I support their entry
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Mr. Speaker, I believe that the floor is open for discussion?
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Yes
It is open for discussion
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
As mentioned in the section of Ministerial Review, I have cleared mentioned that Caelesta could undergo a little more of internal development before they apply for membership. My first interaction with them was through my esteemed colleague, Mr. Snagoveanu back in February this year when they were new to the community, however, the several months of inactivity which grappled the nation immediately after its foundation is unfortunate and indeed concerning.
It shall be better if Caelesta puts in a little more effort in expanding internally. As of now, it shall be a no from my end.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
In reality, I believe that if they have at least some stable government that they should be allowed in regardless. The internal affairs of a nation is not really the affairs of the alliance, in most cases.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Caelesta is active and has seen quick development now that they are no longer inactive.
I support their entry.
But I am pretty biased.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
The nation returned to activity just weeks back. A stable government does not only mean to have a Head of State and a Head of Government. Their parliament lacks members as it mentions that the parliament is the principal law making body. It has 3 seats out of which two are vacant.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
The entire process of allowing nations in is based on personal bias of the primary delegate.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
I guess so
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Applicant delegate, would be a better terminology.
I began to do Delegate review of the applicant delegate only.
Vishwamitra is no longer present.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Bye.
Anywho
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Decorum please
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I would support their admittance.
I have retained decorum .
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
still here?
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I simply said goodbye.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
You could've said moving on or something similar instead of anywho.. but I guess it's not that important.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Okay…
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
Can you continue the session? I can take over if you're busy
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Sorry
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
I propose we just conclude the session and reschedule to a later date. The speaker is not active, nor are many delegates.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
My connection went out
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
Oh, nevermind.
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
That's really unfortunate.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Since all discussion is over, 10 mins of the session is given for national reports.
Sertor Valentinus - W. Sayville: 
Caelesta would be an excellent addition to the alliance.
I can vouch for them.
Pun Watta - Orientia: 
Orientia will be intermittently present from this point forward, due to personal matters.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Thank you for notifying
Ștefan Snagoveanu - Snagov: 
New Snagovian constitution which will adhere to Snagovist principles is in the works.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Indradhanush recently published its birthday honours on December 1
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Vishwamitra is intermittently present.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
Thank you for informing. Also session will be over after national reports.
Liam Alexander – Galte: 
During the prince’s regency, Galte has recently introduced a decree that forces citizens to renew their citizenship to promote activity in the nation during a period of transition
Pun Watta - Orientia: 
Pip Lim, General Secretary of the Communist Party, has been elected as Premier with a percentage of 53.8%. I have also returned to the post of President after a unanimous vote.
Dhrubajyoti Roy - Vishwamitra: 
Leader of Opposition David Brooke resigned from Parliament and relinquished citizenship, amid scandal in regards to his coercing of the Government for his party's benefit. Following the departure of Brooke, the seat held by him in the parliament fell vacant and shall be filled during the by-election to be held in January 2022.
The GSP, which had its status as the chief opposition party in the parliament prior to Brooke's departure, lost the said status as no party outside the government has required 10% of the total seats.
Chandrachur - Indradhanush: 
The 149th Session of the CA is hereby adjourned lasting 1 hour. I thank to all those who attended.
Larry Martin - Waterside Park: 
Nothing from me
I also support the act.
I am in total support of Caelesta's admission.
They're regaining activity, they're amazingly professional, and they're rather progressive too.
Not to mention how their delegate has been very friendly.
I believe it's formatted for American/British readers.
I think that's just how MW formatting is supposed to work, as per the rules.
